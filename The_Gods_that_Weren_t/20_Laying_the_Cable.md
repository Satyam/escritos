# 20 - Laying the Cable

"Good morning, Boss. Can I get you something?"

He had been slowly waking up for a while now, but has kept his eyes closed and  his body quiet because, being the chief aboard he felt he should always look sharper that the rest and waking up like a zombie didn't feel quite dignified. It was time for a sound test.

"Good morning, Galve" he said, quite satisfied with the solid sound of his voice, "Is that fruit juice you have there?"

"Yes Sir, I thought it would do you good, here", said Galve, handling the plastic pouch to Kaylo.

He was floating in his knapsack, which was attached to the wall.  He pulled the zipper down to get his hands out and reach for the fruit juice which he drank slowly. He also grabbed a moisturized paper towel from the tube, to refresh his face.

"Everything Ok, Galve?", he asked, already knowing the answer by Galve's relaxed stance.

"Everything is good, Boss, plenty of news from the ground, but none are urgent. Take your time, the rest of the crew is waking up fine, Bale is already up and about.  I'll go and check on Rola, she seems to be opening her eyes.  You Ok?"

"Yes, go ahead, take care of her".   Once Galve floated away, Bale came into view.  "Good morning Bale".

"Morning, Boss", he replied.

They would have another exciting day ahead of them.   The four 8-shaped loops of graphene ribbon they had received the previous day were nicely attached to one another, a pair of them on each side of the habitat. Today, they would have to catch four more and the last four the day after.

The cable in between the planets could not be shipped in a single piece, there wasn't a big enough rocket to handle that much weight.  However, they wanted to have the least possible number of joints in the ribbon, which were possible points of failure.  Thus, they build the cable into the least number of pieces that could be raised by the most powerful rocket  in stock.  To do that, they had to sacrifice attitude control.  This meant that the cable segments would be able to reach orbit but would be unable to perform the delicate maneuvers to approach and attach to one another. Basically, they were left adrift. 

The job of Kaylo's team was to capture the cable segments when they passed close enough to them.  Since that would take at least three days, their first task had been to build and equip the *habitat* where they would live and work while putting the cable segments together.  They didn't call it a station because it was a temporary structure.  Some called it the barn, others a shed or even a lean-to.  The precariousness of the place was inescapable, at least in terms of comfort.  Safety, however, had not been compromised.

It took a full day for the team to reach orbit, inflate and harden the habitat and equip it so they could live and rest in it and then capture the rest of the equipment that was flown in successive rockets.  Amongst them were the attitude control systems for the cable segments that would turn them from a costly piece of flotsam into proper maneuverable space cargo.

The habitat was an inflatable cylinder with domed caps made rigid by filling the space in between the outer and inner walls with a foam that turned rigid and provided further insulation from the outside void. Several flaps of cloth provided fixing points for various external devices.  A rigid structure at one end of the cylinder held the airlocks where the capsules could dock.  The other end was attached to the frame that held the cable segments together. The cable segments were attached in pairs at each side of this frame.  Each pair had its two segments at right angles to one another so that each set looked like a four leafed clover.  Two more cable segments would be added on each side today and a final set on the last day of their mission.

----

Bale would pilot the chaser capsule this time while Kaylo would remain in the second capsule as a backup.  Both capsules were still attached to the airlock but were ready to launch.  If everything went according to plan, Kaylo might as well take a nap, he was not even supposed to detach unless Bale had any problem.  As a safety measure both were wearing spacesuits, though without the helmet nor the gloves, which could be donned in seconds, should the need arise.

Rola was stepping both of them through their checklist. Galve was monitoring ground communications.  The first cable segment of the day had been launched a few hours ago and had reached orbit less than an hour ago.   It was in the same orbital plane as the habitat so they would eventually meet, but at a slightly lower altitude, so it would eventually catch up with the habitat.  The rocket engine, along the aerodynamic fairing, had been detached from the cable and slowed down so it would fall into a lower orbit and eventually burn in Heaven's atmosphere.

Galve reported on these proceedings specially to Bale who would do the capture this time.  As the ground systems got more and more telemetry from the capsule, they improved their calculations on the orbit the cable had achieved.   An intercept course was calculated and continually updated as more data came in.  

"Ok, Bale, everything checks, you are clear to go," said Rola as she finished the checklist, "Galve?"

"Ground control has a good fix on the orbit of the cable.  They have uploaded the intercept course on your navigation computer, do you have it?", said Galve.

"Yes, the upload finished while we were going through the checklist.  The computer has validated it. I am ready and so is the capsule, shall we go?"

"You are free to detach whenever you want, please proceed", said Galve.

"Here we go, detaching ... detached.  Everything looks good on my side"

"Everything Ok on this side as well.  

The little air that got trapped in between the two airlocks pushed the capsule away from the habitat.  Now the capsule had to slow down to go into the lower orbit the cable was in, but it had to move away from the habitat to maneuver freely without risking bumping into it.

"I hear the attitude rockets firing".  The attitude control rockets used very brief shots of compressed gas so their effect could not always be felt in the body, just the sound of them.

"I can see you moving away from us", added Rola who was now looking through a porthole.

"Agree, telemetry says I'm at 3 meters now, the capsule is going to turn in two more meters".

At this point, the computer was in control and both Bale and the crew in the habitat simply checked that everything was going according to plan.  In due course, the capsule did turn so its main engine was pointing forward.  

"Firing in three, two, one, there it is", reported Bale.

The main engine was the same kind of solid rubber and gaseous oxygen they used in all their vehicles, except that it was split in multiple cells that could be fired independently instead of just a single big combustion chamber.  This allowed for finer control of how much power was delivered.

While the habitat was in a circular orbit, the cable was in an elliptical orbit that was going to reach its highest point in a few minutes.   Now the capsule was in another, less pronounced elliptical orbit that would reach the cable shortly before that point.

While seated in the capsule, Kaylo could only see the habitat through his porthole, but while the capsule was attached to the habitat, he could request on his screens any view from the main computer just as if he were on board. "I can see the flashes from the navigation lights on the cable in the screen," reported Kaylo, "I think I can see the cable now, it is just a couple of pixels wide with the camera zoomed to the max".

The cable was approaching the capsule but as it climbed to the highest point in its orbit, it was slowing down.  The capsule, on the other hand, was falling down and catching up speed so by the time they got close to one another, they would be more or less at the same speed and altitude.  

"I can see the 8-shape now, I can confirm it is not tumbling over, it is spinning slowly, you shouldn't have a problem catching it", added Kaylo.

"I can see you are starting to spin", reported Rola.  While the capsule used its attitude control rockets for translation, it used reaction wheels for rotation.   They were a set of three wheels rotating at right angles to each other.  By speeding them up or slowing them down, the capsule turned in response to that change turning in the opposite direction.  While gas rockets used gas which could not be replenished, reaction wheels were moved by electrical motors whose batteries were continuously recharged from solar panels and they provided an infinitely more precise control.  They were also so silent and smooth that if Rola haven't told Bale, he wouldn't have noticed unless he had some fixed reference to look at through his porthole.

"I'm extending the pole now", said Bale.

Bale would use the grip at the end of that pole to grab the cable while still at a relatively safe distance.   Then he would close in and latch firmly to it.  With the cable spinning slowly, it should be easy.  The problem was that the cable had no attitude control.  All the available carrying capacity of the largest rocket Heaven had was used to put the cable in orbit, there was not left-over capacity for any sort of engines so, if everything went as planned, once free from the rocket, the cable should just carry on gently.   

If, due to any malfunction, the cable was spinning beyond a certain limit, Bale would not be able to catch it. Though they had an extra cable segment ready to be launched if any of the original twelve were lost, there was still a plan B to grab a rogue cable. Bale could shoot a ball through one of the loops of the cable that had a wire trailing behind. They called it the grapnel, though in reality it had no hooks whatsoever.  At the other end of the wire was a small attitude control unit.  If the ball went through either of the loops in the eight, the trailing wire would get entangled around the spinning cable and secure the control unit against it.  There was a further wire with a sticky coating and a small weight after the control unit to wrap it firmly in place.  Bale would have to shoot the ball through either of the loops in the eight-shaped cable and immediately escape to avoid getting itself entangled in the wild mess of spinning objects.

They couldn't predict where in the cable or in which orientation the attitude control box would get attached but with nozzles pointing in every possible direction, once ground control started getting telemetry from the control box, they could figure out which nozzles to fire to slow the wild tumbling to a reasonable spin.   This, however, might take several orbits and delay later operations, but it was still a better option than launching the spare cable.  No further launches could happen until the rogue cable could either be captured or, if too out of control, slowed down until it entered the upper atmosphere and felt to the ground.  The habitat was in a higher orbit so it would not be affected by this, but the delay would get it close to the end of its planned lifespan.

So far, all cables had behaved well and this one was no exception.  Bale had already captured one cable, as each crew-member had.  Capsule and cable were spinning at the same, slow rate.  Without nearby visual references, Bale could not tell how fast they were approaching but the computer signalled it was all going according to plan.  Bale had direct control over the pole and the grip at the end.  He had to insert the grip into a funnel-shaped collar around the socket.

"I can see it clearly now", reported Bale. "We are spinning at the same rate. The socket is still sideways to my view, but I should have a clear shot at it once it passes by."

"We can hardly see you now, but all the telemetry looks good.  You are clear to go."

After a few seconds as the cable passed by the side of the capsule, Bale used his joystick to point the end of the pole to the funnel in the cable.  As he guided the pole, he stretched it so it would get closer and closer to the funnel until it touched it.

"I'm touching the funnel now, stretching the pole, it is going in, slowly, slowly does it. It's in now, a little bit more.  It clicked, I have it, I have a green light, it's firm in place.  I have it."

"Congratulations, Bale, telemetry shows you have a good attachment.  You can now reel it in", said Galve.  Soon the other two joined in the cheering. 

"I'm closing in now" reported Bale, which was a closer description of the truth than 'reel it in'. Due to the weight differences, it was Bale's capsule that was doing most of the approaching to their common center of mass. "I have stopped now.  It's aligning".  The grip could grab the socket in any orientation, coming from any angle, but the capsule had to attach to the cable in a very precise position so, once close enough, the motors in the grip would start getting the cable and the capsule properly aligned.   Bale had markings painted on the cable to confirm this.  "We are aligned now, closing in again, closer, closer, bump. I'm in".   Everyone could read the same telemetry he saw in his instrument panel so his report did not need any precision.   If the telemetry hadn't worked, he wouldn't have be able to be any more precise anyway.

"I can hear the whir of the clamps closing, one green, two green, all green.  We are attached.  I'm turning now".  Once a firm attachment was confirmed, the on-board computer wasted no time as doing a course correction.  The cable and now the capsule were both in a highly elliptical orbit, which didn't go high enough to reach the habitat and the rest of the cable segments.   The closer to the higher point in the elliptical orbit they did the burn, the less fuel they would use to reach the final orbit.  The capsule was using even the gas nozzles to help the cable and capsule get in the proper orientation for the burn.  The capsule was relatively noisy now, with the nozzles firing, the reaction wheels whirring and, quite suddenly, the main rocket engine firing at full power.

"Main engine is on", shouted Bale over the noise. "Off now, everything is quiet.  I have 15 minutes until the next firing so I'll grab a bite right now, guys".

"Same numbers here, we'll do the same and toast to your health", assuming you could count sucking non-fizzy, flavored water out of a plastic pouch as toasting.  Bubbly drinks were uncomfortable in no gravity as, once inside the body, bubbles couldn't find their way up and out.

----

The cable would take several dozen orbits and a couple of journeys to reach the habitat.  With its weight, it would have taken too much fuel to speed things up.  Bale, however, had no need to keep trailing behind.  After a couple of course corrections in a single orbit, Bale would detach his capsule from the cable, leaving an automatic attitude control system attached to it, and return to the habitat.  The capsule with a single passenger was light enough to make it cost-effective to do a rapid maneuver to return to the habitat while the cable, with its course now fixed and its own attitude control system would eventually arrive. Besides, they had three more cable segments to arrive that day and they couldn't waste a capsule and a crew member idly trailing behind one of them.

Once the capsule arrived back at the habitat it would be readied to serve as backup for the other one that would now capture the next cable segment.  Thus, the two capsules would alternate just as the four crew members did.

They captured the second cable before the first one had arrived.  Kaylo did the capture this time with Galve standing ready in the backup capsule.  The cable was spinning somewhat faster than Bale's and it took all of Kaylo's ability to capture it. He had tried a couple of times and he was on his last try before giving up and shooting the grapnel at it when he finally got the grip into the socket.  He suffered a wild ride when he was forced to spin along the cable until his engines could slow it down.  He didn't have much control over it, the only decision he could make at that point was bailing out by detaching the capsule from the cable.  The on-board computer could also do it if the sensors on board signalled the stress on the capsule was too much.  Neither did. Some parameters reached the yellow zone but none got into red.  However, the whole operation had taken a while longer so, once he finally left the cable with its autonomous control unit on its slow orbit up to the habitat, his own return took a longer time.  He was on rations for a couple more meals than originally planned and got thoroughly bored, but other than that, he returned fine.

The first cable was just arriving just as Kaylo was reaching the habitat.  Usually he would have had time to dock and get into the habitat before that but the difficulty in capturing the second cable had delayed his return.   It would not have been wise having part of the crew distracted helping Kaylo dock while the cable was arriving so it was decided that he should wait and, perhaps, help with the process if needed.

The frame that held the cable segments together had a robotic arm to help in handling heavy cargo.   It was made of three long articulated segments, one of them telescopic, and a wrist at the end with a socket for various tools.  It was now ready with the grip to catch the cable segment as it closed by.  Rola was at the console watching the views of various cameras in her screens along with the telemetry.  Her hands were in the joysticks that controlled the arm. As the cable very slowly approached the habitat, Rola extended the arm and inserted the grip into the socket, as Bale had done when first captured.  The arm, far more powerful and flexible than the capturing pole, was able to maneuver the cable into its new position behind the two cable segments on one side of the frame.

Once firmly attached, Galve took over the arm controls from the tired Rola and helped Kaylo dock.  Kaylo could dock by maneuvering the capsule under its own power but it was safer and cheaper on the propellant gas supplies to use the robotic arm to do so.

----

After a long nap, they had to get ready to splice the ends of the new cable segment to the end of the previous segment.  Two of them would go out of the habitat in their spacesuits while the other two would remain inside the habitat, one controlling the robotic arm and the other monitoring the whole operation going through the checklist.

The cable was actually a ribbon barely a millimeter thick and half a meter wide. It was made of millions of layers, each of them a large sheet of a single continuous mono-crystal an atom thick.  The various sheets were so close to one another that they held together as a if they formed a single crystal.  However, that could only be achieved at the moment of fabrication.  The ends of the cable segments could not bond in the same way.  They had to be glued together and, once cured, they would hold together almost as strongly as the original bond but it was more than twice the thickness barely exceeding two millimeters. The last few meters of each cable segment were separated in a dozen layers and to get them glued together, they had to alternate the layers from each of the cables in the splicing unit.  

The floating crew-embers would pick a layer of each segment and thread it into the splicing unit. Once in place and properly aligned, the rollers would dissolve and wash away the protecting coating, lay the new layer over the previous ones, gluing them together, pressing and heating them up for curing.  Back and forth with each of the dozen layers on each side.  For the cre-wmembers it involved a couple of minutes of delicate and very precise manipulation of each new layer into the splicing unit and then do nothing but keeping an eye on it just in case.  If suiting up and going through the airlocks was any easier, they might come and go in and out of the habitat for a rest but, unfortunately, it wasn't that easy so they were stuck waiting outside.  They were attached via umbilicals to the habitat so they had no limitations on autonomy but on the long run, their stomachs craved for something more solid than the juices and broths each could choose to supply his/her suit with.

----

In the meantime, Pinnacle was getting ready for its end of the cable. The project was changed from the original.  At this point, the full cable system could not be afforded.  A much smaller version would be built.  It would only carry cargo, not passengers.  Passengers required life support and a fast transit time.  Cargo, on the other hand, could take as long as needed, needed no supplies and if anything failed, it could be discarded.  Each individual cargo pod in the redesigned system would take half a year to travel but, with a pod being sent every few hours, Heaven would get a continuous stream of them.  Passengers and express cargo would still have to go in rockets.

Also, it would initially be only one-way, from Mother to Heaven, as the tonnage planned was mostly in that direction. A second cable would eventually be laid allowing for two-way traffic.

A small service pier on the side of Pinnacle was enlarged to get construction equipment and material through an existing access tunnel cleared in the base of the structure without disturbing or even changing much of the general look of the main buildings including the Temple.  The area had been used for services and maintenance facilities so it didn't look that different, the main changes were happening inside Pinnacle itself so they weren't obvious from afar.  Nobody wanted the most orthodox complaining of the defacing of their sacred places.

Most of the heavy construction was done on the Heaven side. Mother and Heaven didn't move in a perfectly circular orbit around one another. As with most celestial objects in closed orbits, they moved in an elliptical orbit. It was quite circular for the standards of such celestial matters, but still it meant that the distance in between the two planets varied by a couple of hundreds of kilometers. That much cable had to be reeled in and out twice per year. The equipment to do that was build on Heaven.  Other perturbations, the wobbles Allucio perceived through his telescope, needed some more flexibility but were of lesser magnitude. They varied from perturbations in the orbits of either planet, the influence of other celestial bodies or earthquakes close to either anchorage. With cargo traveling along the cable, the Coriolis force would make the cable draw an arch, not a straight line, in between the planets, thus, by letting it curve or flatten more or less the cable would take care of this on its own.

------

Kaylo and his crew had finished assembling the train of cable segments.  Twelve of them were attached to each other, six on each side of the central frame where their habitat was still attached.  There had been no surprises with the last four segments so they had ample time to do a final check and return to Heaven before falling asleep at the end of the day.

The main thrusters for the train of cable segments had just been launched.  They had to detach the habitat from the frame since the thrusters would attach in its place.  The robotic arm had a firm grip on the habitat while the latches that held the habitat against the frame were opened.  When they were all free, the robotic arm stretched out pushing the habitat away.  It would let it go when the thrusters finally arrived in order to capture it.  The habitat would then slowly start to drift away.

"Time to go", said Kaylo, "Rola, set us free, please".

"A little push now and, we are free now", reported Rola.  "I'm getting ready to capture the thrusters now".

"Bale, how are we doing?", asked Kaylo.

"We are moving away in the right direction, speed is fine, we are safe"

"Ok, Galve, you may come in now", ordered Kaylo.  Galve had been in one of the capsules, ready to give the habitat a push if there had been any risk of them being in the way of either the train or the thrusters.

They were all looking at the same views either from the outside cameras, specially the one at the tip of the robotic arm, or the telemetry.  They all knew it was not a good time to distract Rola so they all remained quiet.  Galve entered the habitat almost tiptoeing, if that was possible while floating with no gravity.

"Almost there", reported Rola, "almost there ... I have contact ... getting in, I'm in, closing the grip, closed"

"All, is green, you have it Rola, congratulations", said Kaylo.

Attaching the thrusters to the frame was a delicate maneuver but it had no uncertainty.  When you had to capture a large object flying by, you had a few chances for a good shot at it and lots of things could go wrong.  Once firmly gripped, it was a matter of time to do it properly and if anything went wrong, they could sit down (figuratively, of course) and think about it.  They could take turns at it.  It was certainly a slow process, the masses involved were not trivial and you couldn't rush them.

They had been drifting away from the train, which was a good thing as they didn't want to be close to the thrusters firing.  Even in the vacuum of space, the rockets would produce enough gasses to produce a minor shockwave but without an atmosphere, it dissipated safely in a short distance.

Once all the diagnostics were run to make sure everything was firm in place and ready to go, the thrusters were fired and the train got on its way.  From the habitat, they could see it on the screens and through one of the portholes.

"Ok, crew, time to go", said Kaylo.

Before separating from the frame, they had used the robotic arm to detach the engines from each of the capsules and attach the aerodynamic shells in its place.  The shells were vital on re-entry so in order to ensure they would not be damaged while working with the capsules, they were not installed until the very end. The re-entry system included a few rocket chambers instead of the full engine since on its own, without having to tug the cable segments, the capsules didn't need that much power to de-orbit.

The interior configuration of the capsules was also changed from a roomy one-seater to two tightly packed stretchers. It was time for them to done their full spacesuits including the helmets, since there would be not enough space once in the capsule.  The suits would provide a little more safety in case of depressurization while going down.  There had never been such an accident recorded in living memory and in regular flights, hibernating passengers didn't even have a spacesuit to wear but with their capsules having been worked hard during the past four days, it was worth having the extra margin.

Bale and Rola were the first to enter their capsule and leave.  Someone had said Kaylo, being in charge, should have been the last to abandon the habitat but since he was a sleeper, it was safer if Galve, being an insomniac, was last since everyone else might get drowsy.  It was not unheard of that sleepers, after a day of hard work and/or excitement, upon relaxing got drowsy earlier than their normal day/night cycle would suggest.   

An orbit later, Galve started the re-entry sequence.  That should bring them close to where Bale and Rola had landed a few minutes earlier with the reception team ready for them.  Kaylo was, indeed, sleeping when they reached the ground.

The habitat had the former main engines of both capsules attached with all the remaining combustion chambers.   They were remotely fired to slow it down so it would burn in the atmosphere.  Explosives were set in the habitat and in a few major pieces of equipment to ensure nothing got to the ground in one single piece and damage something or hurt someone.

----

The train would take a couple of days to climb up to the midway point where it could float freely, balanced in between the two planets.  However, it didn't need to wait until that moment to start deploying the cable, it could do so once the gravity gradient was low enough.  There were a couple of smaller thrusters at each end of the train, around the rim of the fairing that would protect the end of the cable when entering the atmosphere of each planet.  Both sets of rockets were fired at the same time, pulling at each end of the train in different directions and starting the deployment of the cable.

Now there were three separate parts in the train, the central part containing only the main thrusters, now mostly empty, and the central attitude control, and two groups of cable segments, two half-trains, departing in opposite directions, linked by a thin ribbon. The ribbon had been wound in an eight figure like a rope on a ship's horn cleat so that the loop on one side of the eight compensated the twist on the other side. This was better than having it rolled because the roll, once it started spinning would had become very hard to control due to gyroscopic effects.

Instead of having the cable concentrated in the central part and the loose ends flying apart, it was better to have the two half-trains of 6 cable segments flying away from each other, leaving the cable laid out in between them. The alternative would have been to have each end speeding down towards each planet pulling the rest of the cable behind.  Each half would have caught so much inertia that, when it reached full extension, it would be unstoppable and would break.

The two half-trains could not be left to fall freely because they would end up going too fast.  The ribbon would be yanked from the eight-loops at ever increasing speeds which might tear it or entangle it.  The alternate pull on each side of the eight would induce unmanageable vibrations.  So, each half-train was trailed by a sort of sled made of two plates of ceramic magnets, one plate on either side of the ribbon.  The distance in between the plates could be adjusted.  When they were close together, they induced electric currents (eddy currents) in the ribbon which then produced a magnetic field that opposed that of the sled slowing it down and keeping them apart from each other.  The electrical currents generated heath that the ribbon had to dissipate so the braking capacity was limited by how much heath the ribbon could handle.  

----

The final segment carried the fairing to protect the cable the last few tens of kilometers once in the atmosphere. The fairing also had some steering capability by means of flaps that would come out on the sides to cause drag. A beacon on each of the anchorage structures was the target of the fairings, however, it was unlikely that it would fall exactly in the bullseye. An airship was waiting at each planet to grab the tip of the cable as soon as it fell since the most gentle breeze would blow it away in no time. 

Though the whole cable weighted several tones, the part of it within the atmosphere didn't reach a kilogram; the fairing itself weighted more than that. The fairing carried another beacon for the airship to home in. The airship had horns attached to its bow, like a two pronged pitchfork spanning ten meters on either side to catch the ribbon in between them. Two more horns were fixed on its sides further back for a second chance. The horns had hooks at their tips to prevent the ribbon from slipping away and were hinged at its base so as to close on the ribbon once trapped. They had practiced the operation several times by shooting the same kilometer long segment of ribbon from the ground with small rockets for the airship to catch it on its simulated descent. The airship on-board computer was able to calculate the intercept course thanks to the beacon on the fairing. That would get them within visual range, then it depended on the pilot.

Since the operation was simultaneous on both worlds, it would be day on one of them but night on the other. The night side would require an insomniac crew and, since they didn't have any trained insomniac pilots residing in Mother, Heaven would do the night capture. 

The cable was expected to land either on Pinnacle or in the sea. As a safety measure, the fairing had a small parachute just in case it veered off towards the city. The cable itself didn't need one since it was so light that it simply fluttered behind. If the tip were to fall as planned the parachute would not deploy since it would only allow the wind to push it further away making it harder to catch the cable.

As the fairing entered the atmosphere, the beacon started to transmit. It was falling at a far slower speed than capsules usually did thanks to the continuous braking, thus, there was no ionization of the air to shield the radio signals. The airship computer displayed a cone with the tip at the fairing enclosing the possible trajectories. The airship was within it, up wind from Pinnacle. As the fairing fell, the cone would become smaller and soon the airship would be left out of the cone. The goal was to keep the airship right off the up wind edge of the cone. The pilot started the main propeller as the airship was left out of the cone and started following it. Then, it was just a matter of seconds until the fairing passed slightly left in front of their windscreen, with the ribbon trailing behind. The pilot put all the engines at full power, to catch the cable as soon as possible, before it was blown away by the wind. In a matter of seconds, the cable got trapped in the left horn and the copilot closed the horns to trap it. The airship then slowed down and turned towards Pinnacle.

The top of Pinnacle was no longer a solid platform, it now had a hole surrounded by a balcony. The cable was to pass through that opening to the anchorage inside. As the airship hovered over the top of Pinnacle, a group of people in the balcony around it caught the ribbon with the help of poles with hooks and secured it. The tip of the ribbon was in the water where the fairing had fallen. To reach it, they threaded the ribbon through a set of powered rollers that would reel the ribbon in. When they reached the tip, they let it fall into the structure.

The last few tens of meters of the ribbon thickened back again and then separated in layers, temporarily enclosed in a sleeve to keep it clean. The platform that Allucio and Ferbin first saw when entering the structure was no longer hanging in the void, the platform covered the whole area at that level, you could no longer see the volume below. In the center of it there was a slit. It was formed by the edges of two steel blocks that hung below the platform. Its purpose was to clamp the ribbon and prevent the split in between the layers to propagate upwards and tear the ribbon apart. The bottom part of those blocks curved gently outwards to allow the layers to fan out.

The tip of the ribbon, still with all its layers in their protective sleeve, was threaded through that slit. When enough of it had gone through, two technicians started tightening the bolts to bring the two halves of the block together. The block could not hold the cable down when operating, it was only to stop it from flaking off, but it was enough to hold it against the wind so the guys on the outer rim could now release the ribbon from the rollers which were still holding it.

The tip of the cable was now hanging down into the cavernous interior of the anchorage structure. It was no longer the empty hollow space Allucio and Ferbin first saw. The anchorage was finally built and screwed down to the structure via the bolts that were embedded into the concrete foundation. The anchorage was made of several beams of steel, all pointing to the slit where the ribbon was coming out. Each of the beams had a polished face, where the ribbon was to be glued. A separate movable plate of steel would be also glued to the other side of the ribbon and bolted to the fixed side. The ribbon would then be sandwiched in between these two.

The process was very much as it had been done on Heaven's orbit except that instead of glueing the ends of two ribbons, it was one ribbon against the steel plates bolted to the foundation of Pinnacle.  After taking out the sleeve and dissolving the protective coating on each layer, glue was applied and steel rollers pressed each one against its steel plate.  A second plate was glued on the other side of each and then bolted to the first, fixed plate.  Heating elements would then warm the plates to help in curing.

Another large structure was being finished, a solar power station that was to power the cargo pods. The pods would have photovoltaic cells to power their electric motors but to get enough energy out of the sun, they would need to be too large and heavy. Instead they would be fed from the concentrated beam of lasers, allowing for much smaller panels. The lasers would be produced by a power station placed in the stable point two thirds of a right angle ahead of the midway point. It had also been assembled in Heaven's orbit out of a few shipments and then pushed to its final destination.

The power station was made of a central nucleus with a series of focusable power lasers, one for each cargo pod. They received their power from a series of photovoltaic cells around it. The cells were made of graphene ribbons with a photovoltaic layer all radiating out of the central unit as the petals of a huge flower. They were not rigid and were kept open flat by centrifugal force by slowly turning the whole system. They had also been deployed by centrifugal force. Initially, all the ribbons were spun one over the other all around the central unit. Then, once it was in the proper orientation pointing towards the sun, it was spun quite fast. The clamps keeping the ribbons tight against the central core were then let go. As they started to stretch out, they ate into the momentum of the central unit and the whole thing slowed down. Initially the ribbons were curved in gentle spirals around the center but as they spread, they straightened out. The outer tips of each ribbon were tied to the tips of its neighbors which forced the ribbons to turn and lay all flat facing the sun. Small ionic engines were attached to the tips of some of the ribbons to change the orientation of the whole system so as to keep it always pointing to the sun. A similar station would be placed in the trailing stable point, symmetrical to the existing one, to serve as a backup and, with the two of them operating, to eventually double the carrying capacity of the system.

Another power station was built on Mother in a field in the outskirts of Pinnacle City. It would power the cargo pods during the first stages of the ascent. It was felt it would not be a good idea to get a laser coming from outer space shining on the ground. Though it got diffused along its travel through such a big distance and then passing through the atmosphere so that it wouldn't shine much brighter than the sun and it wouldn't blind anybody, there was a good chance people would object. Thus, a ground based laser would power the pods through the first stretch. Until the capacitor bank got build to store power during the day to spend during the night, the ground based laser would not work at night. For the first trials, this was fine.

The first pod carried a standard cargo plus letters from the Supreme Priest and the Head of Government Enuas. The platform at the level of the Observatory had become the preparation room. The climbing mechanism was first attached to the ribbon and tested up and down several times with power provided via an electrical power cord. The cargo itself was packed elsewhere and attached to the climbing mechanism in the preparation room. The climber was then sent, powered still through the power cord until it reached above the tip of Pinnacle where the light from the laser could shine on it. The pod and the laser were connected via a radio link. Initially, the laser, set at a very low power, scanned the general area where the pod should be. The pod then send a signal back to the laser to tell it when it had been hit by the laser. From then on, the pod would continually send the laser information telling it when it was pointing off center. Once focused and at full power, the climber started to go up, faster and faster. 

The promenade was by no means as full as when Fania took off but, still, plenty of people had concentrated there, slightly less even than those who saw the cable arrive and get caught by the airship. At that distance, they could only see the pod as a shining dot as it was hit by the laser. The cable itself was hardly visible since it was edge on to the laser to prevent it from getting burned, only a short segment on either side of the cargo pod shone under some diffused light from the laser. The shining dot dropped out of sight quite soon. The laser beam could be seen now and then as it traversed some cloud. If the clouds got really dense, the space-based laser would take over.

The pull of that first cargo pod would be felt on Heaven fifteen hours later as it propagated along the cable at the speed of sound. The pod itself would take thirty times as much.

The toughest part of the trip was the initial one through the atmosphere. The pods had two propulsion systems, one based on rollers, the second on contact-less linear induction. The induction system was inefficient at low speeds and the currents induced on the ribbon would overheat it and even burn it, however, once the pod was up to speed, out of the atmospheric drag and with less gravity, it was much better than the rollers. Thus, after almost an hour, the lower section of the climbing mechanism, the one containing the rollers, detached from the pod and started to fall back to Mother. It would go down braking all the time, its speed limited to how much heat from the braking it could radiate away or dissipate in the air. Anyway, there was no rush as the next shipment would still be hours away.

Power was not required beyond the midway point, from there on, the pod would be falling. The laser no longer shone on it. If left alone, the pod would accelerate to tens of thousands of kilometers per hour, burning up in the atmosphere and melting the cable on its path. The pod had to go braking all the way down, but braking produces heath and in the vacuum of space there is no easy way to dissipate heath, you just have to allow for enough time to let it radiate away. But first, you had to avoid being warmed up. The solar panel that was kept facing the laser while going up thanks to the reaction wheels, was turned edge on towards the sun to avoid that major source of heat. The solar panel was on hinges so it could be turned independently of the rest of the pod which embraced the ribbon on both of its sides. The ribbon itself could be twisted. It was fixed to be edge on towards the ground laser when coming out of Pinnacle and it was kept always edge on to whatever laser was pointing at it. For the descent, there were no lasers involved, the cargo just coasted down, so the ribbon was twisted by the pod itself to be edge-on to the sun. For the last few kilometers, once in the atmosphere, the air helped in the braking. 

When cargo had to go faster than the cable allowed, rockets had to be used. Humans and other extremely time-sensitive cargo would travel by rocket as they did before the cable was in place. Other express cargo would be carried in rocket powered pods. These would ascend via the cable as any other cargo but would detach from it once in space. The rocket would then push the cargo the rest of the way. A heath shield would slow down and protect the cargo when reaching Heaven's atmosphere. The available payload on an express pod was half that of a regular pod. The rocket, heath shield, parachute and navigation equipment took a good chunk of the space in the pod but it cut the travel time to less than a day.

On arrival, the cargo container was discarded while the engine was shipped back to Mother, twenty of them to a rocket, to eventually repeat the trip.
