# 17 - Making the Structure Public

Together, the Librarian and Allucio caught Master Enuas attention in the refectory. They weren't able to tell him anything right there, with so many people around, but they did get a slot in his schedule to talk to him privately. They both went to Enuas office with Bengo trailing behind them carrying the drawings and a larger picture of the mosaic in the Temple. They also carried a few pictures of themselves inside the structure, though none of them really showed the magnitude of it. The place was so vast that they had not been able to light it enough to show any significant part of it. A picture of Bengo standing by one of the bolts at the bottom of the structure provided for some size comparison, even if only to one tiny piece of the drawings.

Their five minutes turned into twenty minutes. Towards the end, Enuas called his assistant to schedule time to visit the structure. He asked the Librarian whether he would join them but he declined alleging his age and that he had been there already.

"Then, it is going to be the two of us, Master Allucio. I think we have some matters to talk about", said Enuas looking at Allucio and after an instant to let it sink, he added, "I still feel I dumped Sciences on you and it is only fair to learn how are you doing. Can you come by my office so we can talk while we walk up to the Observatory?"

There was certainly a lot Allucio had to tell Enuas, which he had not been able to say in their previous meeting with Anisia and it seemed obvious Enuas wanted to hear them. Of all those in the know, at least of part of the story, the Librarian had excused himself, Ferbin had left with his group and Enuas had just provided an excuse to exclude Bengo from the visit so they would be alone.

----

"So, can you tell me what it is that thing built under Pinnacle? Do you have anything more than guesses? Is it theirs?" asked Enuas as soon as they were alone in the path uphill.

"It is an anchor for a cable linking Mother and Heaven. This is not a guess and if by them you refer to the people of Heaven, yes, it is theirs. And ours as well."

"What do you mean ours?"

"Well, it was build to link Mother to its colonies in Heaven. When it was build there was no 'them', we were not separate societies yet. Time has led us along different paths, but we were originally one and, hopefully, we will become one once again."

"Well said, Master Allucio, well said! It gives it a whole different perspective, doesn't it? It is not 'theirs' but 'ours', of both of us. Good point. So, an anchor you said?"

"Yes, sir, they have a very strong material, far stronger than the best steel we can produce, that can go from Pinnacle all the way to a similar anchor on Heaven".

"They developed it?"

"No, sir, we did, I mean, we both did when we were one people".

"One people, you say. It sounds incongruous. Back then we were killing each other. Blessed be Elvar".

"Blessed be Elvar", replied Allucio automatically. After a brief respectful silence, he added, "The whole system to which these anchors belong was build based on the availability of that material. No other material can handle the stress, none that I knew. They have showed me the material, a little sample of it. Amazingly strong, sir, unbelievable so. I worked out the numbers and it seems a miracle that it can be done. By the way, there is another anchor up there in Heaven and we have the drawings for it as well".

"It reminds me of the tale of the boy following the talking squirrel up the magical redwood tree. But lets leave the technical details for later, does it represent any danger to us?"

"As far as I can tell, sir, no. It is just a means of transportation. They already travel in between Heaven and Mother, but the vehicles they use right now, chemical rockets, are very expensive. This would increase their capacity ten-fold, or so they told me."

"So, you have discussed this with them."

"Yes, sir, two years ago, when they first contacted me, they showed me the material they would use for the cable and they told me about this transport link in between our two planets."

"You seem to know a lot, Master Allucio", said Enuas somewhat reproachfully.

"Sorry, sir, I was asked to be discreet and, until a few hours ago, I didn't know you didn't know".

"I guess it is only fair, Allucio, I kept the secret myself. So, it is not a weapon?"

"No, sir, none that I can think of. You might transport troops and weapons, but not very many at once. The cable is strong, but it can only hold so much. I can't imagine it being useful for an invasion. After all, their whole population is about a hundred thousand. And if they were to use weapons, I guess they could have build terrible weapons right here already and used them if they wanted to."

"A little short of a hundred thousand, that is the number they gave to me as well. Do you believe those numbers?"

"I can't really tell, sir. If you mean whether I could see them or not, no, I wouldn't, even if they were ten times as many. I'm not sure if I could see them if they were a hundred times as many. They told me they live under domes because their atmosphere is not thick enough to breath in the open. As long as they have to live underground or sheltered somehow, I wouldn't be able to see them through the telescope. They told me I must have seen their fields but, unless they plant their crops in very regular patterns, which they don't, I can't tell them apart from wild vegetation."

"So, we may assume that there is no risk of physical violence".

"None that they couldn't do right now if they so wished".

"Sorry if I sound a little paranoid, but I have to cover all possibilities".

"I understand, sir. I thought about them as well".

"So, what is it they want it for? Just to take a vacation? They plan to move en-masse?"

"I wouldn't mind visiting their planet myself."

"So do I. And if they were to migrate here we could easily accommodate that many people without any problem."

"They want to transport raw materials they need. They are short on some raw materials, mostly organic materials, that don't grow in Heaven. They ship those regularly", sensing the eyes of Enuas on him, he repeated, "yes, regularly sir, once a day, via rocket. They ship those at great cost. Their population is stuck at its current levels because that's all their shipments can provide for. If, for the same cost, they could ship ten times their current weight, their population could grow by that much. That's assuming a linear relation, which is probably not the case."

"No, nature doesn't work that way."

"It rarely does so, sir. Indeed, they told me that if they reached eight hundred thousand, they would then become self-sufficient so there you have a discontinuity. I guess that means that from then on their population could grow indefinitely".

"They'd have to breed like rabbits, an 'exciting' thought, don't you think?"

"Well, sir, if you put it that way, yes. Anyway, judging from that conversation of two years ago, I don't think they have an indefinite growth as their goal. They mean to reach and pass the eight hundred thousand mark, but not by much. Just enough to ensure self-sufficiency and a little margin for safety. What I sensed was a concern that their whole existence was at risk right now. Their survival relies on a very fragile set of conditions, the supplies from Mother being one of them."

"Yes, they told me that much. They told me their population is always at risk of being decimated should they have massive crop failures or deceases. I wouldn't like to have that on my conscience. If only for that, I would like to help them."

"But you still seem concerned, sir".

"Well, yes, Allucio. I'm afraid of the consequences to our society. They have too much technology and technology can be used both for good and for evil. Would we be able to cope with it? And that's not counting the religious issues. Why did it have to be right here in Pinnacle?"

"Physics, sir. Geometry, if you will. They put it in Pinnacle for the same reason we have build our Great Temple in Pinnacle, to be closer to Heaven. Theoretically, the anchor could be placed somewhere else, not too far, but then you start to have lateral forces and lots of other issues and it soon becomes impractical. Besides, both anchors are already built. So, here we are, sir. If you wait for me for just a second, I'll go to the Observatory to fetch a few things and then we can go into the structure".

----

Allucio showed Enuas the structure from the top platform. He had brought a carpet for the earlier visit by the Librarian and he had left it there for his increasingly distinguished visitors to lay on.

"I wish I could have a better look at all this and understand it better, but I have an important meeting scheduled soon and I'll be arriving late. Please come along, Allucio", said Enuas as they were coming out. "Get this fixed right away, call maintenance", he said when passing under the ladder that was still holding the roof at the entrance. "Let my assistant know if they can't come immediately. Better yet, let my assistant call them to tell them to contact you for an urgent job".

"Yes sir. Should I put some railings on that platform?"

"No, no one goes beyond that door. Who else knows about this?"

"The Librarian and Bengo, who came with us to your office, and Ferbin, a student who came with the retinue of one of the High Priests, who has already left. He is an insomniac and helped me with the digging, I couldn't have done it alone. They've seen it but they don't know its true purpose. Then, people from Heaven who reside here on Mother".

"I'm a little lost here, if the cable hangs down to Mother and it hangs down to Heaven, where does it hang from? It is just floating up there?"

"Well, yes, sir. The center of gravity of the whole cable and the carriages traveling along it is somewhere close to midway in between the two planets, slightly closer to Heaven since it is the larger of the two. It is in a spot where the gravitational forces of both planets balance just right so it falls neither way".

"Is that stable? It isn't coming down on us, is it?"

"Theoretically, it could be stable. In practice, with the carriages going up and down, orbital perturbations and the wind in the atmosphere, it has to be balanced. That's the reason these anchors exist. Each should contain a big windlass to pull the cable in or let it go. Either you send perfectly balanced carriages simultaneously from each side or you have to have these windlasses pulling from the other end to compensate. The same with other perturbations".

"They told you all these or you figured it out?"

"A little of both plus a little help from these", replied Allucio showing a couple of magazines.

"Fantasy magazines?"

"Well, yes the covers are a little gaudy, aren't they? It's called Wanderers Magazine. They do publish fantasy, techno-fantasy it is called but they also publish essays. I had an article on astronomy published there, something for the general public".

"Under your real name?"

"Yes, sir. Really, sir, they have good articles, it is not all fantasy. Nights are long for an insomniac and some light reading is always welcome".

"Oh, I see, of course. So, you wrote about this thing here?"

"No, sir, I read about it. Well, not about this one specifically. Someone used a system like this as the basis of a fantasy story. The story was short on technical details and what it did have was wrong for the better part. Anyway, the story was mostly about the conflicts with the monks at Taprobane who owned the place, a thinly disguised reference to Pinnacle and us, and then in a second installment, it described the exploration of the other planet. Complete bullshit, if you pardon the expression, sir".

"I wouldn't expect less from a magazine that looks like that".

"You see, that is what makes this magazine different, they publish these fantasy stories and then they try to get the science right and they invite their readers to participate and discuss it. The story about the cable wasn't bad, as fantastic literature goes, it simply got most of the science wrong. But then, readers started writing to the magazine about the idea of getting a cable in between the planets and the editor picked the best and commented on them. There is still an on-going discussion about that, there is always a paragraph or two in the 'letters to the editor' section".

"That can't be casual".

"I had the same thought, sir, but I am not sure. Overall, this is one more transportation system of the many described in the magazine and it doesn't get any particular attention. Rockets with fantastic propulsion systems are, by far, what the stories talk about and in the essays section; amongst the more realistic ones, it is just one out of many. Of those, none has all the details right. Lots of original ideas. They really seem to have been developed independently".

"I'd like to talk to those people, I wonder how to bring the issue without giving this anchor away".

"No need to be concerned about that, sir, they know. I was about to tell you. The editor of the magazine does know about the structure, she's been here".

"You invited her?"

"No, sir, they just showed up the night I was digging. They are insomniacs".

"Them? Now it's more than one?"

"Two, sir, to be precise, one you have met. She was with us with the wireless when you talked with the person from Heaven, Anisia is her name."

"So, they are from Heaven".

"Anisia is, sir, Fania, the editor, is not, she is from Mother but has been contacted by them just like we've been. Moreover, I believe the story and the letters that followed about this cable in between the planets went on before she had been contacted".

"I feel we are being manipulated, Allucio, and I don't like it".

"I felt the same, sir, and told them so. We discussed the issue and I am fairly confident that is not the case, well, not for the most part anyway".

"I'd like to hear why you think so, but I have no time for that right now. So, get that entrance fixed and made safe. I'll tell the Supreme Priest and I'm sure he'll want to visit it. I'll let you know. I want to meet these two women. Tell them to expect a formal invitation to come here, my assistant will schedule a time. I want them to bring all the letters, or a summary of them, I want to know all the reactions to this cable, the bad ones as well, specially the bad ones, I want to know what are we against. Can this lady bring the wireless? I'd like to be able to talk to Anric if possible. Can you do that?"

"Absolutely, sir. Fix the entrance, expect the Supreme Priest to visit and tell Anisia and Fania to expect an invitation and what to bring".

----

The Supreme Priest came along with Enuas a few meals after the midday eclipse. By then, Allucio had the entrance shored up with sturdy railroad sleepers and an extra door with a padlock. He lead the way with the lantern and then, when they had laid down on the two carpets he had now placed in the platform, lit the flares to illuminate the empty vastness. The Supreme Priest was said to be a quiet person, which Allucio had a chance to verify. Once outside, he suggested they went uphill, explicitly inviting Allucio to go along.

Once at the top and after watching Pinnacle City extend below, he said, "What a magnificent view we have from here. The shops there on Elvar Boulevard are full of trinkets to sell to the pilgrims coming out from the Great Temple. I heard a picture of myself on the balcony addressing the people on the temple esplanade is the top seller these days but the all-time best seller is a model of Pinnacle, in clay, metal or glass; painted, gilded, small, medium, large, any way you want it, you can buy it. Elvar's Twelve Notebooks? Most of the stores don't even carry a single set. This is what we are left with, worshiping miniatures of a fake mountain".

"In the meantime, my fellow Priests are devoting their time to solving petty disputes like how much of the crop goes to each sibling or for how long must each sister take care of their father. How can I preach love, peace and understanding when few listen? Perhaps people realize that the rituals I perform are as hollow as this mountain?"

"Blessed be Elvar", he said after a brief silence and while his two companions mechanically repeated those words, he turned around and started on his way down. "Do you see?" he said turning to see the two trailing men, "Do you mean what you've just said? Have you thought about those words? Are you grateful for his legacy?" Allucio stopped and looked down to the floor while Enuas, clearly more at ease, simply replied with a gesture. "Come with me, brothers, I have a long way to go and so do you. Reaching the foot of this hill is just the beginning".
