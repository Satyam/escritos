# 18 - A Visitor from Outer Space

Allucio was going back to his apartment after delivering a lecture when he heard the usual level of noise increase even higher and the students running for the exit. Some of them would walk two or three steps when passing by his side as if trying to gain their composure for a while, but run again after that. One of them, a student of his, turned around and said, "Excuse us, sir, there's something big floating down through the air well off the coast".

"Have you seen it?"

"Just for an instant through the window, sir, but then it went behind Pinnacle and we lost it".

"Go ahead, then. Run", and started what he expected was a more dignified trot along the rest of the students and as he came out of the building, they joined the rest of the crowd along Foothill road that circled the base of Pinnacle, serving all the buildings around it. Then he saw it, a half sphere of a translucent material of a greenish tint and under it, apparently linked by some invisible thread, a tiny dot leaving a trail of white smoke behind. It was hard to tell how big it was but it seemed to be quite far so it had to be big, though it was falling very leisurely. Then three red flashes came out of the tiny shiny speck hanging from the dome, each producing a shiny trail of smoke. Allucio recognized it as an emergency flare, the model that comes with a parachute so it hangs out in the air for longer, but the size didn't match the regular flares you can hold in your hand, it was far too big. He looked towards the port that was closer to the coast, partially sheltered by the peninsula where Pinnacle was located and he saw boats rushing to the rescue. It was obvious they had recognized it as an emergency flare and were going to offer assistant to whomever sent that signal.

Allucio went back towards the pier that served the kitchens and the service area. The boats would pass close to the tip of it and he might board one.

"Sorry, mate, this might be dangerous, we are carrying no packages", replied an approaching fishing boat using 'package' to refer to a useless passenger.

"I'm a guild member, rated able seaman, apprenticed with Captain Nogan", shouted Allucio mentioning a well known captain he had embarked with. "You might want a professor to see what is it there", continued Allucio stretching the folds of the gown he was still wearing from his lecture.

The man at the wheel cut the steam to the engine and steered closer to the pier. "Can you jump?"

"Aye", replied Allucio while raising his gown to free his legs for the jump. A deckhand who was tidying up things on the far side of the deck came across expecting to catch him if he failed the jump. He got hold of a shroud as the boat passed by and jumped on board landing with style as if he'd done it all his life. He went to the wheelhouse to introduce himself. "Allucio, Chair of Physical Sciences, Pinnacle, thanks for taking me on board".

"Lasio, Mate and this is Konilu, welcome on board. The Captain is on shore on some errand".

"You got out fast, were you leaving?"

"No, we had just unloaded by the fish market and were ready to move to cheaper anchorage when we saw that thing falling. That's why we had steam pressure in the boiler. Is that your sailing uniform?".

"Hardly. No, I was teaching, that's what I do nowadays, but I worked the night shifts in the canal boats to pay my studies. I did some open water sailing for my rating".

"An insomniac? Ah, there is good money to be made at night. Can you take the wheel then? We had just unloaded and the deck is still a mess, I want to be ready for whatever we find out there and those you are wearing don't seem to be proper working clothes".

"They are good enough for my daytime job, you know, but yes, I can steer"

The mate moved to one side offering the wheel to Allucio who took it. He stayed for a while in the wheelhouse, checking how Allucio handled riding a couple of waves. Once satisfied that he did fine, he went up to the deck.

----

Five minutes later it became obvious the big dome was a parachute for, as soon as the load landed on the water, the parachute lost its shape, then it was released so it drifted away downwind. It was hard to judge the size of it but, since it still took 10 more minutes to reach the thing floating in the water, it must have been big. Two boats had arrived earlier. There was a white barrel with an opening at the top, surrounded by an orange, inflatable ring keeping it afloat and an empty inflatable raft in the water. Everyone was looking at the deck of one of the boats were a person dressed in orange was sitting in the middle of a puddle of water. Lasio had taken the wheel from Allucio after they had cleared the deck and Allucio and Konilu were at the bow holding at either side of the stay.

"Make way for the Professor here", shouted Konilu. Allucio walked back to the shrouds and stepped over the railing and, when he was near enough, boarded the other boat. A couple of sailors had reached out to help him but moved out of the way when they saw he could manage on his own. As the people around the stranger stepped aside to let him pass, he recognized Jobas and it was evident that Jobas had also recognized him and so reacted before Allucio had any chance to say anything.

"Sir, if you please, I am a traveler from far away. I come from the colonies in Heaven. I traveled through space and my craft has failed and so I had to land here".

"Are you well? Were you alone? Shall we search for others?" asked Allucio following Jobas game of not knowing each other. Jobas accent was somewhat strange, not what Allucio remembered. Perhaps that was the true accent of people from Heaven, when they weren't pretending to be from Mother.

"I am well, just a little cold. I was the only passenger". He had a blanket on his back, but his clothes were soaked.

"And your craft?"

"It is ruined now and there is nothing valuable inside, you can let it sink, otherwise, it isn't heavy, I'm sure it can be picked out of the water. There should be an eyebolt inside a yellow circle, you can hook it up from there".

"Can we get dry clothes for this man?" asked Allucio, "What is your name?"

"Jobas, sir, thank you".

"Captain?", said Allucio looking at the guy who seemed to be in charge.

"Aye, Professor, Captain Contri, at your service"

"Thank you, Captain, I'm Master Allucio. Can you take us back to Pinnacle?"

"Right away, sir. Would you like to step down to the cabin, sir".

"Thank you Captain, yes that would be perfect. Can you walk mister Jobas?"

"Yes, sir, but I seem to be a little weak, I'd rather remain seated here until I find my legs. Thanks for the clothes", he added looking at the sailor who was handing him dry overalls, "but I'd have to stand up to change clothes and I'm not sure I can do that so I guess I'll keep mine for the time being. I'm Ok with the blanket, thank you". A cup of hot tea soon appeared as well.

The captain immediately started giving orders, the sailors of the other boat returned to their own boat, and they untied the boats and pushed on each other to drift apart. Lasio had not bothered to tie up to the other two boats and was floating nearby. Allucio's boat departed towards the port while the other two closed on the capsule. A sailor jumped on the inflatable boat while another extended the boom they used to raise the nets towards him. After unlatching the winch, he picked the moving block hanging at the outer end of the boom with a boat-hook and handed it to his mate on the water. Standing on the inflatable ring surrounding the capsule, leaning over it, he had already a sling passed through the eyebolt Jobas had mentioned. As soon as he put the sling in the hook, he retreated to the inflatable boat, untied it and pushed himself toward the boat, which he immediately boarded. With little effort, the winch raised the capsule out of the water and it was soon on the deck. Once everything was securely tied to the deck, they were on their way to the port.

----

Allucio could see people standing all around Pinnacle, out of the windows or the roof of buildings, over Foothill road. There were people all along the Promenade, over the breakwater in the port, on top of the seafront buildings of the city, wherever they could get a look. Allucio wanted to talk privately to Jobas, but there were always people around. He didn't understand what was going on. Initially, he assumed it had been an accident and Jobas' landing had been a real emergency and he meant to keep his origin secret. But then, Jobas declared he had traveled through space from the colonies in Heaven. That was far from discreet. What was going on? He couldn't figure it out, but was unable to ask Jobas.

Allucio recognized Enuas amongst a group of gowned people standing by the breakwater around Pinnacle. Allucio stood up and waved Enuas.

"Captain, can you drop us at the service pier over there?", shouted Allucio.

"Aye, sir, no problem"

Allucio then waved Enuas again and pointed to the pier. Enuas immediately started towards it. The pier was crowded with the cooks and all the people working in the kitchens, which the pier served, and other maintenance people. Shouts could be heard repeating, "Make way for Master Enuas! Make way!" Hands were ready both on board and on the pier to help Jobas reach solid ground. Allucio jumped right away to meet Enuas.

"Master Enuas", said Allucio aloud, "allow me to introduce to you Mr Jobas, a traveler who claims to come from Heaven. Mr Jobas, this is Master Enuas, Head of Government".

"An honor to meet you Master Enuas, my name is Jobas, a space traveler from Heaven", said Jobas with his native accent extending his hand towards Enuas, knowing very well from his previous experience that it was not the proper thing to do with a person of Enuas' status, clearly playing the foreigner.

"A pleasure to meet you Mr. Jobas", replied Enuas once recovered from the surprise, shaking Jobas' hand. "Do you feel fine?" asked Enuas seeing he was being helped by one person on each side.

"My legs are a little weak after floating in space for three journeys, but I am much better now, standing on solid ground. I think I can walk now with little help. If you please gentlemen", he said, gently pushing his helpers aside finally keeping one hand on a shoulder of each.

"Do you want to try walking?", asked Allucio.

"Here, sir", offered someone arriving with a wheelbarrow, but his offer wasn't accepted. Jobas tried a few steps and then let one of his helpers go and continued slowly ahead.

"Your lodgings are in the ground floor, aren't they Master Allucio? They are close enough, perhaps we can go there. Do you mind hosting Mr Jobas for a few hours?" asked Enuas.

"Not at all, sir, Mr Jobas is very welcome. I'm afraid, though, that my clothes wouldn't fit him".

"Yes, clothes and permanent lodgings. Mr Boras, can you take care of that? Are you hungry Mr Jobas? I imagine you should be. Some refreshment as well", said Enuas to one of his assistants.

"Thank you Master Enuas", said Jobas, "My craft, sir".

"The craft he came down in, it is on board of one of those fishing boats, yes, I see it, that one just reaching the breakwater", added Allucio.

As Boras had already left, Enuas ordered another of his assistants to get in touch with the port authority to hold the capsule in custody and eventually transport it to a suitable place in Pinnacle. Finally, he turned around and said, "I'll come by your lodgings in no more than two hours, Master Allucio, in the meantime," he added raising his voice and looking all around, "I am sure we all have duties to attend to. Please, carry on, there is nothing else to see here. Move now."

----

"So, Jobas, it seems you are famous now, the man that came from Heaven. The word is spreading like wildfire. All Pinnacle City seemed to be at the Promenade watching your inglorious descent. And then, you telling everybody that you came from Heaven! How could you possibly say that for everyone to hear?" said Enuas once alone with Jobas and Allucio.

"I am sorry for all the trouble but it was no accident".

"You meant to say that?"

"Yes, sir, it was on purpose, as was the landing. It was not an accident".

"You planned all this?"

"Yes, it was one of the plans we had prepared and we decided to go ahead with it after the first discourse of the Supreme Priest".

"And you didn't consult with us? You didn't even warned us!"

"I'm sorry again. No, we decided this was the best course of action. The surprise was part of the plan as well. I don't know if Allucio had any chance to explain to you how we decide on these matters."

"No, Jobas, I have not, I haven't had the chance to do so."

"Well, we may discuss the means later but we did evaluate the benefits of surprise against upsetting you and, of course, the Supreme Priest and there was a clear advantage in favor of surprise. Had the benefit been less clear, we would have done otherwise".

"So, can you tell me what do you expect to gain with this show?"

"The goal is always the same, let our existence be known so we can communicate, trade and live together freely as one people. The election of a Supreme Priest who is in favor of that goal led us to believe it was within reach. His creation of a civilian government and placing you at its head was a further boost. We expected you would gain power in the new hierarchy and knowing the Supreme Priest to be deeply religious though at the same highly pragmatic, we expected him to focus more on religion, delegating the everyday civilian affairs on your shoulders. We had not anticipated he would establish a completely separate civilian government, or civilian courts for that matter. That was even better, completely unexpected, but better".

"But why this show?"

"We evaluated different ways to make an announcement. In all the ones where we delayed it or did it piecemeal both the Supreme Priest and your own image would have been tarnished. They would imply you knew about us and you kept it a secret, basically, that you had lied. Questions would arise as to how long did you know about us and, if before the Conclave, it wouldn't be hard to imagine we somehow influenced that election."

"Haven't you?"

"No, we have not. To be frank, the best choices for us would have been a couple of old, conservative High Priests. Our studies showed that either of them would have gotten almost everybody so fed up with them that in five to seven years -as I said, they are old- a new Conclave would have elected an even more radical modernizer. This would have been better for us, even though we would have had to wait a few more years, but not for you. Your economy would have slowed down, the young would have learned more prayers and less science, young women told to have children instead of studying. A large proportion of your youth would become unemployed and clearly dissatisfied. Idle youngsters with no future often rebel. No, it wouldn't have been the best for you. It might have been good for us because, under a later Supreme Priest, a more modernizing one, we might have even been seen as saviors, bringing all the science and technology of the future in contrast to a previous backward-looking conservative regime."

After a few seconds when he envisioned that alternative, Enuas asked, "But why the surprise?"

"Letting you know in advance offered no advantage. You or anyone else. Few of our own people down, sorry, I mean here, in Mother knew. Some are being told as we speak, others will learn about it in the news. A spontaneous reaction, your surprise, was the best choice. We will have to apologize to some, as I apologize to you, for not telling them in advance."

"I have no choice but to accept that assumption to be true, since I can't undo what's been done. Needless to say I've been with the Supreme Priest for muchof this past hour. It was deemed inappropriate that he should come with me. We assumed your landing had been an accident and we were trying to find whether to cover it up, which would have been nearly impossible after that show you put up there in the sky, or make your existence public. We haven't found any satisfactory formula. Am I right to assume that, since it wasn't an accident, that you came prepared for that as well?"

"Glad you've asked. Yes, I am. Here I have several options. I kept these papers with me in a waterproof pocket in my overalls. Sorry, they don't seem to want to stay flat again. They are suggestions of ways we could handle this situation. They are not instructions, just ideas and suggestions, and several alternative ones at that. Once again, I'm sorry we gave you no choice in getting into this situation, but I hope we'll get out of it successfully".

"So do I, Mr Jobas, so do I", said Enuas while standing up ready to leave.

"One more thing, sir, if you please. There is a visitor I am expecting".

"More people falling from the sky?"

"No, sir, she is a local resident, Ms Paniul is her name, you both know her by her real name, Anisia. She learned about my landing and rescue shortly after it happened. She is to bring some medicines I need and equipment to take care of me. Most people on Heaven are sleep now and so should I but I changed my sleeping pattern to be able to talk to you. I just woke up about an hour before landing and I'll stay awake for the better part of the night. To fully adjust to your day/night cycle I need some medicines and someone who knows how to administer them. She will ask for Master Allucio. Can you make sure she is let in?"

"Certainly. Anything else? Something from your craft?"

"You can do whatever you wish with the capsule. I've purged the fuel tanks and ejected anything dangerous upon landing. If you or your people want to examine it, I'll be happy to help. Make sure nobody tries to recover anything that I dumped. The parachute would be a tempting souvenir. Make sure they don't try to fish it out from the deep, the lines hanging down from the canopy are dangerous".

"Graphene?" asked Allucio, remembering Jobas and Marlo earlier demonstration.

"I see you remember. Yes, they are graphene.  The parachute was weighted so it would sink and the lines were coated with some chemical so they will dissolve in about two days once in water".

"Those lines can cut through flesh as if it was butter, sir. We'll have to tell the fishermen to stay away from the area. If they drag it up in their nets, they can get seriously hurt".

"Noted, I'll give the order. Anything else?".

"Well, Anric, whom you both know, is staying at the City Hotel. He is one of the few who knew about this. If you want him to join us, he is waiting for your call. Otherwise, if you don't want to discuss this with him, I am sure he would prefer to leave and reach home before nightfall to sleep in his own bed. Since my sleeping cycle is messed up, I will be asleep for the most part of the day tomorrow. Anric resides here in Mother and his day/night cycle is the same as everybody else's. And he is our top guy in Mother".

"I'm sure we'll need all the help we can muster. What name is he using in the hotel?"

"He's using his own name, Anric, Mr Anric."

"I'll call him and arrange for him to stay here during the night. And Ms Paniul as well."

"She is an insomniac, she'll take care of me during the night. Perhaps you can arrange for us three to stay close? One sleeper, another sleeper sleeping at odd hours and an insomniac."

"I'll have one of my assistants to check on our guest houses. We'll find something suitable. I'm going to meet the Supreme Priest right away. I will probably call you shortly. You as well, Master Allucio. You have more lectures today?"

"I've already taken care of my schedule, sir. I'm free for the rest of the day".

"Good. Then, we'll be meeting soon enough. Until then, gentlemen".

----

"Well, Mr Jobas, I have to admit I am somewhat relieved to have the decision taken off my shoulders. I had not found a way to make the announcement. Now, it is done. However, why the rush?" asked the Supreme Priest after the introductions were made. Anric had just arrived.

"As I mentioned Master Enuas, Your Grace", replied Jobas who no longer acted and sounded as a foreigner and was using the proper honorific, "we didn't want your future decisions in our favor to be suspect if the announcement was made days from now. Earlier today -I was asleep, but got briefed before landing- in your discourse you mentioned the rights of everyone regardless of 'beliefs, gender, age or origin'. What did you mean by 'origin'? Was it social status or wealth? Perhaps you meant place of origin? Does that include whether born in Heaven or Mother? Should we have shown up later, would have anyone gone back to this discourse and say, 'see, here is the proof he already knew!'. Any statement, order or directive from Your Grace or Master Enuas would be equally suspect".

"You might be interested to know those words are not mine", said the Supreme Priest, "I learned them from a teacher of mine, a scholar who studied ancient texts. We now tend to believe everything from before the Great War was bad. Not so, not so. There were very many good things in those days, but we lost so much of it! I always cherished those words. I come from a family of no status, landless, raised on charity. Hunger brought me into the priesthood, vocation came later. That is the kind of origin I was referring to. But I see your point, even though I can explain why I said that, suspicion would not go away".

"Right now, when new charters and laws are to be written, we would like to participate. If we kept quiet, we would have relied on the influence of others, such as Your Grace or Master Enuas. Any suggestions from either of you in our favor would later be tainted. In this way, we can participate openly, if we may. We have records of many similar documents from earlier times. Your teacher would be delighted to read them".

"I am sure he would but, unfortunately, he passed away a long time ago. The input from your experts and your archives will be highly valued. What I am concerned now is how the people will react".

"That is my specialty, Your Grace. I spent two years living in Mother two years ago. I met Master Allucio the eve of my departure back to Heaven. I've been studying the issue since then. The purpose of my visit here was for me to evaluate this society by meeting people, reading their literature, sensing their fears and expectations. Our societies are different, the image we, the public of Heaven in general, have of you is quite different from reality. The easiest label we put on your government is 'theocracy' which, for us, has a scent of whimsical authoritarianism. This is not true, the bottom-up pressure of the Mothers and their Council plus the provisions Elvar the Pacifier set in his Twelve Notebooks prevents that. But you have to come here and live it to really understand it and see how it works. I also had to evaluate means by which we could sense the mood of the society. We cannot run opinion polls. We had to find indirect means to do that such as through the news sources, your writers and even your comedians. We published books and articles here and there to see how the readers reacted to them. We publish magazines, one of which you know, Master Allucio. The Wanderers Magazine is our creation, well, the idea of it anyway. We were lucky to recruit Ms Fania, its editor who was not in our original plans. As we speak they are holding conferences with futurists and techno-fantasy fans and organizing more, all of them with great success".

"Techno-fantasy?"

"The term is theirs, Your Grace, not ours. That is how they call themselves. They are readers of novels, many of them set in the future or in other worlds with different cultures, with large doses of science and technology in them. Some of those foreign cultures are not unlike our own. As a matter of fact, a couple of stories we published were slightly edited versions of stories whose action happened in real, everyday places in Heaven".

"You've lost me, Mr Jobas, how can this fantasy help you?"

"They were probes we dropped to see how readers reacted. We invite readers to write to the editor and we evaluate those letters. That is, of course, besides the comments from literary critics and the sales numbers or the attendance to our conferences. All that helps us evaluate how people feel about certain subjects which are important to us".

"I see, interesting idea", commented Enuas.

"I was sure you would appreciate it, Master Enuas, an effective government needs to sense how the people feel. We'll be happy to help you with that. Finally, Your Grace, there is the 'eight day optimism' rule. People feel optimist about their new rulers. We've analyzed that with many instances at the regional and local levels as well as with a few of your predecessors, Your Grace. People expect change and feel optimistic about it. Later on, those changes can happen or not and they can be for the good or not, but the expectation about good things to come is always there and it fades in about eight days. We could not afford to wait for eight days and miss the opportunity to ride the wave of optimism".

"Mr Jobas, administration and government is not my strongest point. I have been lucky to have highly qualified people around me like Master Enuas. I believe we could benefit greatly from your input".

"Thank you, Your Grace, but it is not just me. We have an excellent team up there and wonderful tools to work with".

"That 'computer' you mentioned, Mr Anric?" asked Enuas.

"Partly yes, Sir. Just partly. There is not a single computer, we have lots of them, they are like enormously capable calculators that allow us to process huge amounts of data. We can do statistics on anything we want. We can analyze data we do have or guesses we make. We can change those guesses to see which ones bring the best outcomes. You would need a thousand clerks working a full year to do what a computer can do in a couple of minutes. However, you still have to make those guesses. Finding Ms Fania, as Mr Jobas mentioned, was in none of our guesses. Your discourse, Your Grace, was a complete surprise for us. It took us about two hours to model it and get it into the computer. It was then that the decision to launch Mr Jobas was taken".

"But that was this morning", commented Allucio.

"Mr Jobas' flight was planned, though the date was not fixed. With the data we had before your discourse, we were not sure his arrival would produce the best outcome. We expected to gather more information as the days passed. Your discourse completely changed our estimates".

"I didn't expect to wake up in a capsule falling towards Mother. I was hibernating when the decision was taken and they just sent me. It was not a complete surprise, there was a chance that it might happen and I was already adjusting my sleeping pattern to that of Mother, but by the time I fell asleep, I expected to wake up at home, and so did my family".

"My point, Your Grace, is that computers don't do miracles", added Anric. "They are great tools when used wisely, but they work on the data we give them and we can't control everything, much less predict anything with any certainty".

"Which is a great relief, gentlemen, I wish to believe that I still have the free will the Gods have given us. Master Enuas, if you please, make an announcement confirming the origin of Mr Jobas. Master Allucio and yourself as current and former Heads of Astronomy can, in principle, assert the validity of his claims. Let it be known that I have been informed and that I will make an announcement after the first meal tomorrow. I have the notes with the suggestions that you gave to Master Enuas. Gentlemen, I understand you will stay with us. I might have to call you but, otherwise, feel free to enjoy our hospitality. Thank you".
