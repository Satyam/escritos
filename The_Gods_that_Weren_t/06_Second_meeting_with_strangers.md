# 6 - Strangers with Strange Ideas

Allucio filled pages and pages of notes, diagrams and calculations, though none of it was of any help. He did know about orbits and about dynamics but not enough. He did remember from his studies that reaching orbit with a chemical rocket was impossible and he remembered seeing those formulas but nobody said anything about multi-stage rockets. He was simply unable to prove it true or false.

His family was not curious about his attitude, after all, they assumed that was what he did for a living. He explained that he had just finished one study and he was speculating about what to do next, which is what he should have been doing. If they asked more, he simply explained more until they got bored. He enjoyed good home cooking, received hints about suitable women and endured lots of visits. He was, after all, something any mother would feel proud of, and that made him happy. He had not realized how much his position in Pinnacle meant to her, and how much of the ordinary it was for the people in the town.

He was eager to go to that next meeting with the hikers. At the same time, he assumed they would want something from him, why would they tell him anything if they didn't need some sort of help? So, he took his notebooks and went to the agreed place.

There was nobody there when he arrived. They showed up soon enough.

"Sorry to have you waiting," said Jobas, "we had to make sure it was you and that you were alone."

"Why are you so concerned?," asked Allucio.

"You will know soon enough. Nothing wrong, as you will see, but it does require some confidentiality."

Allucio had to trust them on that or otherwise simply leave so he said, "I've been trying to do some calculations about that multi-stage rocket idea, but wasn't able to get anywhere"

"I'm sure Marlo can help you on that, will you?," said Jobas, looking at Marlo, "I think we can sit on that corner, it looks comfortable enough."

And so, they did. Marlo went through the calculations for a regular rocket, step by step, making sure Allucio could follow him, which he did quite easily. Of course, they both knew the result, the rocket couldn't reach orbit with the weight of the fuel and the tanks to hold it. Then Marlo did the calculations for a multi-stage rocket. By the time the first stage burned all its fuel and it was detached and let fall behind, the rest was much lighter and it was already quite high and going fast so, what was left of the rocket had it much easier. Besides, the nozzle on that second stage could be better adapted to the air speed and pressure at that height, making it far more efficient. It was so simple once you knew the trick, Allucio realized.

"So, do you accept that it is possible for rockets to reach orbit and beyond?" asked Jobas when they were done, "In other words, do you accept it is possible for people to travel in between Heaven and Mother?"

"Theoretically yes, it seems it is possible. Have you?"

"Well, someone is up there sending signals with light. Or something, if you want to speculate that it might be some automated device. In either case, someone or something is up there and we can communicate with whatever it is, don't you agree?"

"Yes, it would seem so. It is an automated device then?"

"No, there are people up there. I just mentioned the alternative of an automated device which would still mean travel from Mother to Heaven is possible. But let me show you something else that I'm sure you'll find interesting."

He took a small metal cylinder from one of his pockets, about the size of a pen, unscrewed it and separated the two sections about half a meter on top of a flat stone that served as a table. While Jobas was doing this, Marlo took a round of cheese from his pack.

"Please take the cheese from Marlo," said Jobas and Allucio did, "Check it out, it doesn't have any cuts in it, it is just one piece. Now, give it back to Marlo."

Marlo took the cheese and placed it on the stone, in between the two halves that Jobas still held. Then, Jobas raised the two halves of the cylinder. The cheese moved slightly even while he wasn't touching it. Jobas finally screwed the two halves of the cylinder together and asked Allucio to pick up the cheese and, when he did so, he found that it was cut in half.

"As you can see, the cheese is now cut, you could not see it being cut because the blade that cut it is so thin that you could not see it, nor the cut it made. If this had not been a cured cheese, the moisture would keep the two halves glued together. Now I'll open it again, please be careful, don't even try to touch it or you will lose a finger ... or a limb."

Jobas unscrewed the cylinder again and let one half fall, which it did for a couple of hand-widths until it started swinging like a pendulum. "There is a very fine thread of a very strong material in between these two handles. It is so thin you can't see it." He moved it towards a beam of light that projected from one of the openings, what used to be a window. "Sometimes, it may catch the light and you can see it shine ... uhmm, no luck. Anyway, let's try the cheese again." And he sliced the half lying on the stone once again, a cut so thin that Marlo had to pick one of the halves to show it had been cut. "Master Allucio, can you pick that branch over there and hold it in front of you?"

Allucio did and Jobas moved the two halves of the cylinder one on each side. Allucio was able to feel something pressed against the branch, though nothing was visible. "You see," said Jobas, "wood is somewhat stronger so you can feel the thread pushing against the branch. Now, hold it firm, I'll have to saw it." It didn't take long, Jobas just moved the thread back and forth a few times across the branch until it got cleanly cut. Allucio could feel the pressure even though he couldn't see it. Jobas closed the cylinder again.

"Now I'll give it to you. The thread is inside the cylinder that serves as handles. It has a spring that winds it in when you close the two halves. So, you can unscrew it and take the two halves apart. The thread is half a meter long so that is how far the two handles will move apart. When you are done, close it. Don't try to touch it. Keep it away from your body or ours."

Jobas gave Allucio the cylinder. Marlo placed the half of the cheese he still held in his hand over the stone slab. Jobas picked up another branch. Allucio repeated the tricks he saw Jobas do. He barely felt any resistance from the cheese, while he had to saw the branch. He tried to pull the two handles further apart, but it wouldn't budge. He finally closed it.

"So, what is it?," asked Allucio.

"It is a wire made of a few threads of carbon molecules that instead of being crystallized as a diamond, they are made into a tube. The tube is not meant to be sharp but, being so thin, it turns out to be thinner than the best edge you could possibly make in any cutting tool. The rollers inside the cylinder where it is wrapped around are coated in diamond, otherwise, there would be no way to hold it. It would cut through metal, it would take some time, but eventually it would get through. Besides, if you go too fast, heat builds up and it burns, you have to allow heat to dissipate.  But the purpose of it is not to cut but to lift weight. This thread could hold the weight of the three of us; it could actually hold the weight of about 8 people of our weight. That's what it was designed for."

"And you say it is carbon?," asked Allucio.

"Yes, you can have carbon crystallize into graphite or diamond. Those are the ones people find in nature. Raw graphite is made of innumerable flakes of flat sheets of carbon atoms piled haphazardly together. However, if you can control the growth of those flakes, you can produce a continuous strip one atom thick and, if you carefully bring the edges of that strip together, under the right conditions, you can make them bind together so they make a seamless tube. Millions and millions of those tubes make threads that can be woven into sheets. The bonds that link the carbon atoms together are very strong so the whole tube is very, very strong. As a matter of fact, nature also produces sheets and tubes and spheres, they are there in soot or in charcoal," said Jobas while pointing to the remains of a fire in the floor and the soot in the roof, "but there are so tiny and in such small quantities that nobody realized they were there. What we managed to do is to make those strips and tubes in a continuous process so we can spin out a continuous thread. And I really mean continuous, like never-ending, we had to develop a whole technology to cut that thread and seal the ends of it."

After a long silence, Allucio finally asked, "And why are you showing all these to me?"

"Because we have to tell you a very strange story and we wanted to be able to convince you it is true by showing you the bits and pieces that make it possible. After all, we could not show you a multi-stage rocket and let you touch it, but we can show you this. So, if you are ready and have some time to spare, I'll go through it. Make yourself comfortable," said Jobas while he moved to another place where he could lean on and sit relaxed.

"I told you about the observation post in the midway point in between Heaven and Mother. I also told you that it had been destroyed, but there was another one at Heaven. The one on Heaven actually grew and it turned into a colony. During the decades the Great War lasted, more and more people were sent to that colony. Some leaders sent their families to the colony, some escaped themselves. Some meant it to be a safeguard against the total destruction of civilization on Mother, but the colony had to be self sufficient if it was to be so. Heaven was not completely habitable. There is an atmosphere, but it doesn't have enough oxygen in it. There is some microbial life and, fortunately, it is not harmful, it can give you a fever for a week or so when you first get in touch with the local germs, but very few have died from it."

"The problem is the soil. We cannot easily grow our plants on that soil. It is quite unsuited. There are fungus and lichens close to the water. Most native life is in the water or close to it. The wind might carry microbes or spores overland in the spray, when there is some storm, and if they fall in some lake or river or a simple pond, they usually survive, but they cannot get a hold of the dry land. They can survive for a while in the wet lining of our lungs, if we happen to inhale them, which is rare since we use breathers when out. On the other hand, we have the plants from the seeds we shipped from Mother, but they don't get the necessary nutrients from the soil, not all they need and we have to provide those, artificially. Most of them we manufacture, some of them recycled from our own refuse, some we synthesize chemically. Some, however, we cannot recycle nor synthesize. Some enzymes are too complex; they occur naturally and in a complete self-sustaining environment there must be some microbe, some fungus or who knows what that produces them in enough quantity. We don't have that in Heaven. We have to ship that from Mother. Anyway, the process to make those enzymes and a whole bunch of other chemicals we need is too expensive so it is cheaper to ship it from Mother, where they grow naturally."

"Hold on," said Allucio, "you mean you are continuously shipping stuff to Heaven?"

"Yes, all the time, every day we send a shipment, sometimes twice in a day."

"And people are traveling back and forth all the time?"

"Not all the time. Most of the shipments are cargo only, which uses relatively cheap rockets. We make passenger trips only when required. Marlo and I are due for the next trip, we've been away from home for two years now."

"Away from home, you mean you live there?"

"We were born there, I have a wife and a son there and Marlo is moving in with his girlfriend as soon as he arrives. They were all born there, I mean our families and friends."

"So, how many people are we talking about?"

"About a hundred thousand."

Allucio's eyes showed he couldn't believe it. He stared at Jobas and then at Marlo who nodded while saying "Actually, 98 thousand and something, close to 99; perhaps it has already reached 99, I don't know."

"Marlo, I don't think Allucio minds whether we are 98 or 99, I think it is the 'thousands' part of it the one he finds hard to believe," said Jobas.

"A hundred thousand and I haven't seen you?"

"Well, you have seen us, when we wanted you to see us, remember the flashes?"

"Yes but you must have a big city there"

"Not really, we don't have a single city, we have 8 main colonies and they are all domed, and we never clean those domes on the outside so they are sort of naturally camouflaged so you can't really notice they are there. You don't have the resolution to see the smaller outposts anyway. Remember we can't breath the local atmosphere so we don't go out in the open a lot. Most of our food is grown in hothouses, only cereals and grasses for the cattle are grown outside and we simply avoid geometrical patterns so they just look like the rest of the vegetation and you don't notice. Cattle grows under the dome since they can't breathe the outside air either. We even have fishponds, those you must have seen, but they have no straight edges, they look like small lakes. Actually, some were lakes. We cannot grow fish on the natural lakes because they lack oxygen and other nutrients."

"Camouflage, why all that camouflage, why would you want to keep it a secret?"

"Right now, not much, in fact, we want the people of Mother to know about us, but we started as a secret project, a military project. For decades, our domes remained camouflaged simply because that's how they were built and unless we bothered with paint, which we didn't have, they simply got dirty and blended with the surrounding soil. We were, and still are, somewhat fearful of you, that is, our cousins on Mother."

"But why would you fear us?"

"Many reasons. People fear what they don't know. We are afraid of you, you might be afraid of us if you knew we existed. People don't like to be afraid, they do unpleasant things to whatever causes them to be afraid. For some we might be considered a heresy: we are living in Heaven, the abode of the Gods and of their own deceased ancestors. We are trampling on sacred ground. For others, we are the remains of one of the warring parties of the Great War, no matter that that war and its politics are as foreign to us as they are to you. You see, there are plenty of reasons for fear."

"That's why you have tried to make these meetings secret?"

"Indeed, and not only for our safety, you might also be at risk if seen involved."

"But you said you wanted us to know about you."

"Yes, we need to communicate with you, to trade, to help you and get some help from you."

"Well, you could do some pretty fancy fireworks up there and that would certainly call our attention!"

"I don't think it would be a good idea though. As a matter of fact, a group in one of the colonies tried."

"You did?"

"Yes, and it didn't work. I mean, the fireworks worked, but the effect was not what they thought. They wanted to have people looking up, otherwise nobody would notice, so they spread it as a rumor through a few travelers like us who were here on Mother. Unfortunately only some weird crackpots paid any attention to that rumor. Some self-styled prophets started to associate the announced time and place of the event with all sorts of mystical prophecies and other nonsense. Most sensible people didn't pay any attention to it, actually, they were repelled by those crackpots, and didn't even bother to look up at the signaled time. There are still some followers of the prophet that got the best tale made up from it, but for the most part, those few who were paying attention eventually dismissed the whole thing. You can still find it in the records, I can look for the precise date, but I'm sure that you can find it yourself if you care to; it was about two decades ago. Plenty of sensible, natural explanations were also made up to explain it, your own library at Pinnacle must have some papers on it. Anyway, it didn't serve its purpose. After all, those who did believe the story would have us floating down from the sky, dressed in flowing white robes and with light rays coming out of our fingertips or some such idiocy. Better not."

"But then, why are you telling me now?"

"As I said, we need you to know about us. We can't do it the way we did it twenty something years ago. We can't just suddenly show up and say hello. What we learned from that public relations disaster is that we need to manage it better. So, we are contacting very specific people, one at a time, making sure we understand each other, so that when the time comes to go public, we, and I mean both us on Heaven and you on Mother, can handle the situation. We don't want the crackpots."

"But why now, why me?"

"It's not just you nor just now. We haven't been seating with our arms crossed these last 20 years, this operation has been going for the last 15 years. Some of our first contacts, people who were already old, have died since. And before you ask, I'll tell you I can't say how many or who we've contacted so far. You've been contacted because of your new position and, hopefully, the bright career in your future. It must be obvious that it is us who have been supporting your department and we've had some influence in your career. Don't get me wrong, you deserve it, you are really good, no question about it, so we just helped a little bit."

"Well, thanks, sort of. So, once again, why me?"

"Because you handle the Observatory. We need the Observatory. Well, it is one of the many things we need. We don't plan to steal it or anything like that. As I told you before, we had some pretty bad experience with the people that gathered when we made the big fireworks show twenty years ago. This time, what we want, is a direct line of communication with people in charge of the things we need. We want to avoid misunderstandings, confusion or delays. We don't want you to blindly follow orders, we don't mean to order anything to anybody, we just want to make sure we can get in touch with the right people when we need it."

"And what's so special about the Observatory?"

"Well, it is in a very particular location in Mother, not the Observatory itself but the peak it is in, Pinnacle. It is the closest to Heaven. Heaven is right in the zenith of the Pinnacle. For the last few years you have often been the person at Mother closest to Heaven, and I mean it in a physical, not mystical sense."

"So, you need the highest place on Mother?"

"Pinnacle is not the highest place on Mother, it is the one closest to Heaven but it is not really that high. No, we already have a high enough place, much higher than Pinnacle. Higher in the sense of elevation from sea level. There are plenty of mountain peaks away from any inhabited places, very discreet and all, and we own one, we don't really use it much, but we have one. No, we need the place at zero degrees of fall and none other."

Jobas took the cylinder with the strong invisible thread from his pocket and raised it in between their eyes. "Remember this thread? It is immensely strong, you've just seen nothing of what it can do, just a little trick. Cutting? It could decapitate you and you wouldn't notice for a few seconds until your brains starts to realize it is cut off from your limbs. Your blood would still flow for a while until the blood pressure starts pushing the sides of the cut apart and it finally gets to spill, very little at first. You would feel like fainting, very slowly. That's how we butcher the cattle, as far as we can tell and hope, it is painless. Now, imagine a bridge. Many of these threads could be spun and made into a cable that could support a suspension bridge able to cross the widest span."

"All the calculations for the multiple-stage rocket you had been doing with Marlo a few minutes ago? Those are not our real numbers. In the last decades, we have been using rockets that can go right into orbit with just the help of a small, disposable booster because this material is so strong and light that we can make rockets much lighter than the most optimist estimations used in the equation that proved it couldn't be done. Marlo showed you the equations with the estimates for the strength and weight of traditional materials, he can show you our actual numbers. Most of the weight in the rocket are the tanks for fuel and the structure to support them. We make the tanks out of this material. Remember I mentioned that this thread is actually a tube made of a sheet of carbon atoms with its borders brought together so that they weld to each other making a tube? There is actually no limit to the size of those tubes. We can make tubes of any diameter by laying a narrow band of this carbon sheet like a corkscrew over a drum and welding it with itself. We can make the walls of those tubes as thick as we want by adding any number of layers, each an atom thick, as if they were an adhesive tape laid one upon the other. Those tubes are not rigid, but when filled with fuel at high pressure they turn stiff or we can use solid fuel. Our rockets barely have any dead weight, they are all fuel."

"But you don't need to launch them from Pinnacle," objected Allucio.

"No, we don't, we already have the launching facilities we need. There is another use for this material. Imagine we could have a balloon made of this material filled with hydrogen or helium, tied down with a thread of this material. How high could it go? With most strong materials, the dead weight of the tether holding it down limits the height the balloon can reach. With a paper tether, its own weight tears it. A thread of paper cannot hold its own weight beyond a certain length, much less tether a balloon. Now, this material, it can go forever! Ok, that was an exaggeration, not forever. Can it go to space? Not in a balloon, of course, but you can drop a spool of this thread from a rocket orbiting Mother and it could reach the ground. It would burn, due to the friction with the atmosphere, after all, it would be traveling at more than 20 times the speed of sound, but if it could reach down before burning it would cut anything it finds in its path. Birds cut in half would fall from the sky, anything on the ground would also get some very nasty cuts."

"Wouldn't it float in the high atmosphere behind the rocket?," asked Allucio.

"Yes, indeed, you would have to put some heavy weight at the bottom, in fact, that's why you would drop the spool and hold on to the end of the thread. The spool would be the weight and it would be protected by a heat shield to go through the atmosphere without burning. Sorry, I forgot to mention that."

"I see, no problem, just wondering."

"Now, you know that the higher orbits are slower. You see it in the planets, those further away from the sun take longer and longer to go around it. The moons further away from the planets take longer to orbit their planet. So, if we dropped the spool from a high enough orbit it might go slow enough so that it would not burn."

"It would still cut anything in its path," commented Allucio.

"Yes, unless you get high enough so that it is almost standing still ...," dropped Jobas and let it sink.

"The midway point!" exclaimed Allucio after a while.

"Well, not really," said Marlo who couldn't avoid being precise. Jobas signaled him to carry on.

"Heaven and Mother are in synchronous orbits to each other, that is, their orbital speeds match their daily rotations. That is why they face each other. That would be the stable orbit to lay the cable and make it stationary. However, you are right in that there are several points in space where an object can float immobile with respect to the ground, and one of those places is the midway point. There are others, one is right at the antipodes, which doesn't help us much, and there are others towards the sides, but none of them are as good as the midway point."

"That's where you had the observation post during the war, right?" asked Allucio.

"Allow me to correct that, it is not 'us' who had the observation post. It is as much ancient history for us as it is for you. You lost the records of it while we didn't. That doesn't make you innocent of what it happened in the War nor us any more guilty. We are not responsible for it, we are as many human generations away from those who made the war as you are," said Jobas.

"Sorry," said Allucio, "you are right. I wasn't blaming you."

"No problem, I'm not upset but, you see, I wanted to make that clear. One of the fears we have is that we might be in some way blamed or associated with the War. Our ancestors suffered it as much as yours, and the current generation is as blameless as you are. We happen to have records of that and we are there because of the war, but we didn't make the war, nor did the many generations in between. This is one of the misunderstandings we want to clear up before going out to the wide public."

"I see, you are right. Sorry again. So, that's why you need the Pinnacle."

"That's why the Pinnacle exists," Jobas corrected.

"Are you getting mystical? The Gods put it there so eventually, a thread of carbon would land on it?"

"The Gods didn't put it there, men did. Pinnacle is artificial, it is man-made. Look at the surroundings, mountains don't just pop in the middle of the plains, they usually come in ranges. Pinnacle is at the edge of a floodplain, the surrounding terrain is barely undulated. You have to go inland for quite a while to find anything you can call a hill, and none is as steep as Pinnacle."

"But Pinnacle has been there, I don't know, forever!" objected Allucio.

"Its origins are lost in time, that is true, but it hasn't always been as it is currently. Pinnacle City is, indeed, ancient, though it wasn't called that way since there was no Pinnacle. Our historians suspect that pilgrims traveled to the general area of Pinnacle trying to get closer to Heaven. Nowadays people think Pinnacle City came after Pinnacle, but actually the city is older than Pinnacle and it had many names before. Some of those names still remain as the names of its neighborhoods. Some people wanted to build a temple at the exact spot below Heaven, so they devised better ways to determine the exact spot for that temple, only to find it was not within the city but in the sea. The city prospered with all the pilgrimage business and also because it was a good port, with a navigable river close by to trade inland as well as all over the ocean. So, they started with a pier going closer to the exact spot they were looking for. A pier that also served to protect the port so it was a good deal for everyone in the city, mystics and merchants alike. When they got to the spot, they made their temple, but then they wanted to make it higher and bigger and over many generations one temple was built, then demolished and the whole area raised a little more and a new one constructed which, later on, got demolished to be replaced by a new one, higher up and so on."

"But the main temple is at the foothill of Pinnacle."

"The historians believe that while all this building and demolishing happened, a temporary temple must have been built at the foothill. In the end, it is that temple that remained while more and more height was added to the top. At some point, that temporary temple grew so large and lavish that nobody cared for building anything further at the top. The original pier also grew wider with sand brought by the waves and soil washed down by the river into the delta so now it looks more like a peninsula, well blended with the natural coastline, but historians suspect the original narrow causeway still lies somewhere underneath."

"And what does that have to do with the thread?"

"If you bring this thread down from the midway point, you need somewhere to anchor it, otherwise a storm would blow it away. It also needs to be kept in tension and it has to be reeled in and out since the planets oscillate back and forth a little bit. And you need a station for passengers and cargo. All that is still under Pinnacle."

"What do you mean it is there? There is just a flat platform at the top, served by a road, and the observatory to one side, the rest is forest."

"An artificial forest, at least initially it was artificial. The top two thirds of Pinnacle is an artificial structure intentionally covered with soil and planted with trees. Pinnacle was much shorter and was topped by a wide flat platform where a big temple was to be built, not the pointy tip it now has. The top was built during the war to hold the end of the cable, and it was covered with soil to camouflage it. The soil added weight, ballast, which the cable terminal needed anyway, but the forest is just for camouflage. Over the centuries it turned into what looks like a natural forest. The species are foreign to the area, but people believe the original seeds were brought by the pilgrims from all over Mother, and it was probably so with the trees down near the Temple, but those at the top were planted there for camouflage."

"But then, it means there was a cable to Heaven?"

"No, it was never finished. The war consumed all the resources and there was nothing left for the cable. In the end, all the idea was abandoned, the anchorage itself was never finished, but the basic structure must still be there."

"So, you didn't invent the thread?"

"No. We had to reinvent it because we also had our own catastrophe. We relied on supplies from Mother. When the war ended, our ancestors were left stranded and they barely survived. The three colonies were reduced to less than a twentieth of their peak population. We were also at the brink of extinction, only more so than your ancestors here on Mother. On Heaven we even have to make our own air to breathe. The few survivors moved to the newest of the outposts, the one that was easier to maintain and was smaller than the original first colony which had grown beyond the ability of the survivors to maintain. When the medicines run out, people simply died of the most trivial deceases. Some needed plain vitamins, and they were none. Their diet was reduced to the few sturdy vegetables that could survive without the fertilizers and other supplements that used to arrive from Mother. It was not a complete diet, it didn't have all the nutrients the body needs. Some were able to survive without them and they did, we are the proof of that, they were our ancestors. Fortunately, no records were lost, that's why we were able to reconstruct the story of Pinnacle I've just told you, but most of all, to recover all the technology we had before the war, such as the thread."

"And why do you want to build it?"

"Because Heaven still lacks a lot of things. We are transporting them from Mother at great expense. Our society cannot grow beyond a hundred thousand, more or less, because we cannot ship enough supplies to sustain any more people. Setting up the cable would reduce our shipping costs to less than a tenth of what they are now. Conversely, it means our population could grow ten times, well, not exactly, they are not proportional, but you get the idea. Moreover, we are currently sort of smuggling all we take from Mother so just being able to do it in the open would reduce our costs. But that is not the end of it, we estimate that if we manage to grow beyond about eight hundred thousand or so, we could become self-sufficient. We would have the resources to plant photosynthesizing grasses in such a wide area that the oxygen content would start to increase, very slightly at first, but in a few generations we would be able to be out in the open without breathers. We would be able to grow other crops. We would be able to change the chemistry of the soil to allow for a different ecosystem, a self-sufficient one. Now, we have to tend to the earthworms as if they were pets because when we set them loose to do their thing in the soil as it is nowadays, they end up dying!"

"So, what is it you want me to do? I can't just invite you to have Pinnacle, it is not mine, you know."

"No, we think that, at a convenient time, you get to accidentally discover the structure under the top of Pinnacle. Just that. We need the Order to find that there is something down there. That would get them wondering. We believe it is safer to guide them to an answer they are actively looking for than just dropping the whole thing on their laps. We want them to ask the questions and find the answers, not us giving answers, possibly frightening answers, to questions they never cared to ask. We have some drawings of what we believe it is there. We have checked them and they are not consistent, we believe they might correspond to different stages of the project. The dates are of no help since we don't know which ones were approved and which weren't so the newer might not be any more reliable than the old ones. And we don't know how much of any of this was actually built. Besides, we are not acquainted with Pinnacle as it is now. You are far more familiar than anyone else with the place. It is up to you to decide where to look and under what excuse. Anyway, sometime in the future, when our sociologists believe the time is ripe, a couple of years from now, perhaps more, we'll contact you with, hopefully, better information and ask you to discover what's under Pinnacle. We can still communicate through the lawyer handling the trust that supports the Observatory. I can't imagine these meetings we've had would be enough to satisfy your curiosity. However, we'll refrain from providing you with any proof of our existence. We'll be happy to help you in your research, after all, that would be what your department 'benefactor' would do anyway."
