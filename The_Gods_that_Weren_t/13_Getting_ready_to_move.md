# 13 - On the Move

"Anisia, are you alone?", said Baria in a low voice as soon as she opened the door of her house.

"Yes, I am, come in, you may speak freely."

"Ok, good. We have to pack, we are leaving ASAP."

"What are you talking about?"

"Time to get things rolling. We are coming out."

"Coming out of where?"

"Anisia, you know the dire situation our people on Heaven are. Our people cannot survive on its own, not forever, the whole thing is too fragile. We need to get help from Mother. Secretly launching supplies via rocket is not enough. We have to come clean and get all the help we need. This is the time to do it."

Of course, Anisia knew all this, more or less. She had lived in Heaven, she had worked in the Farm and the Island shipping supplies to Heaven and her neighbor owned a publishing company whose purpose was to bring into the open the possibility that space might be livable and, thus, make the idea that Heaven was populated by long lost cousins more palatable. She had been part in all of it, but she simply didn't realize it would all happen so soon, perhaps not in her lifetime. In fact, she didn't think she might have any part to play in it, she was just living her new life. Actually, nobody had ever asked her if she was willing to eventually come out.

"What should I pack, my space suit, my ray gun?"

"Oh, I see you've been reading my magazine. No, we are going to a 'spiritual retreat' so carry comfortable clothes, and warm ones, those places are dreadful. I prefer sales conferences or product launches, they have them in posh hotels, but I guess they couldn't find any in such a short notice so they went for the 'spiritual retreat' excuse."

"But what about the factory?"

"Jon will stay. You get on with the packing and come to our house. Jon will deal with it. Think of some excuse to leave, some problem at the main factory or some such. Check your schedule for the next work shifts and tell Jon what to do or who to assign it to. Just the important issues, the others, he will cancel."

"Ok, let me think."

"Not now, I have to do my own packing and rescheduling. Start packing and think about it and then come home. We have a couple of hours until our train. Ok?"

"Ok"

"And don't bother closing the house, emptying the fridge or throwing the garbage, Jon will take care of that once we are gone. You didn't have dinner, did you? Jon is fixing something for all of us. Then I'll tell you more, at least all I know."

----

"So, this is all I know. I got a call from Fioni. We are going to meet, about 40 of us, in a retreat. They've rented the whole place for us. They are usually quiet places with very little housekeeping personnel who usually ask few questions, bare rooms, mediocre food and not enough heating. Anric is going to be our guru or whatever story they came up with this time."

"Anric is going to be there?"

"Yes, he is coming from the Farm. You haven't seen him for a while, have you?"

"Well, yes, that is true, it will be nice to see him again, but I was surprised because he rarely leaves the Farm."

"Well, then. Now you know how important this is. You've heard about the Conclave?"

"The conference the High Priests are having at Pinnacle."

"Conference? Well, somehow, that is what it is but it is much more than that. They elect the Supreme Priest, the top guy, the one that sets the policy for the next decade or two."

"And what does it have to do with us? Are we going to kidnap him?"

"No, but we've been trying for years now to influence the higher echelons of the priesthood and there is a good chance that we'll get a far more progressive regime as a result."

"One of ours?"

"You mean a Supreme Priest of ours? No, not so far, but I heard a rumor that we have contacted one, some say two, locals. It would be great if either gets elected, but at least he, or them, might influence the election. Or ensure that the most devout, backward-thinking, conservative guys don't get elected."

"That is fine, but what's the urgency?"

"I don't really know the details, but we have several projects going to make our existence known or at least more acceptable for people here on Mother. My company is just one of such projects. So far, we've been very measured in our progress. I have three alternate business plans and, so far, we've been working under the slow, low-profile one. We sped up a little bit when we got Fania on-board. We didn't plan to have a second magazine until next year, but it would have been a waste to put a lid on her."

"I'm happy for her. Once I learned how good she was, it really seemed such a pity to have her working in packaging."

"That is the way with insomniacs in some places here in Mother. Though now they are not formally discriminated against, they still carry the stigma and some refrain from giving away their condition."

"True, I can't imagine what must have been for earlier generations. For me it was like, 'Oh, so you are an insomniac, great!'. If anything, in Heaven we are overvalued, there are so many things to take care of during the night. No wonder she failed at school, she studied all night without distraction and then had to go back to where the others had left the day before."

"You know that she still keeps quiet about that in public?"

"Well, she still keeps quiet about her name, doesn't she?"

"Yeah, she is still Space Wanderer, editor of the Wanderers Magazine. It took me two days for me to start suspecting her. There was no way she could have done so much work after hours while she still worked for you. She freaked out when you invited her to your place for dinner during the night."

"And I still do, we get together two or three times every night. As a matter of fact, I should charge you for some of that time. She comes with piles of articles she wants to discuss with me. Sometimes it is hard to keep a straight face, they have such weird ideas!"

"Well, you would know more than I. I traveled while asleep, as most of us do. I remember nothing of the space trip."

"Boring, for the most part at least. You marvel at the views when near either of the planets, but then the hours and hours of just being jailed in the capsule with the very same stars passing through the porthole as the capsule spins around is just boring. Then there is a little exhilaration and sheer panic in equal parts when landing. Let me tell you, I wouldn't mind sleeping through it all."

"Good to know. Anyway, I might have to speed up our business plan. We had conferences, fan clubs, meet-the-author events planed for later on, much later on but, if the progressive guys get on top, I might have to bring them forward. It would have been a waste of effort mobilizing the futurists if we had the backward-thinking guys at the top."

"I see, but what's for me? Push more pills?"

"I don't know we have any plans for your company but, perhaps, it is something to do with you, personally. Something that needs to be done during the night? I don't know."

----

"My brothers and sisters, good day and welcome", intoned Anric in his best spiritual-leader voice. "Please have a seat. Someone back there, please close the door". Once the doors were closed, someone in the front, in a voice low enough that it would not be heard outside but that most in the room heard said, "Brothers and sisters my ass", which brought many laughs from those who were already having a hard time pretending.

"Laughter is a fine and healthy thing, my children", said Anric in a loud voice while with his hands gestured to tone it down. "Ok, please guys, shall we start?" he added in a much lower voice.

"As you may know, the Supreme Priest has announced his retirement and a Conclave is now underway to elect his successor. We've been approaching the most progressive and liberal priests and we have even revealed our existence to two High Priests who are now voting in the Conclave and a few more people in the higher levels who can influence their superiors. We have done our best to explain our position to them and helped advance their careers. Not all of those we contacted have believed us and only a few have tried to denounce us but, since our initial contacts are made in a way that can't be traced back to our organization, so far we suffered no damage."

"Though the whole affair looks extremely religious to us, the fact is that the requirements of government has turned the priesthood into a highly efficient administration and the theocratic members of the Orders have been left aside. They still carry on the rituals, use the titles, wear the clothes and the symbols of their offices but, more and more, they deal with everyday practical matters."

"A large part of their legitimacy derives from their religion whose roots predate Elvar's changes, changes that were, in good measure, forced upon him by the dire circumstances the world was in. His repentance of the horrors that the priesthood had allowed or even encouraged was crucial for that change to happen. Thus, we have a religion which is not rigid, after all, Elvar changed it. A religion that is fallible, as Elvar proved when repenting, and pragmatic, it can change if circumstances demand it."

"This reformed religion provided inspiration and stability for the society to recover. It is understandable that a lot of people can be scared of the possibility that any change to the rules that guide their society will bring it down. They cling to what has worked in the past and fear change. We now have a prosperous society. The rules that got them this far fall short of their new circumstances. The more progressive and liberal amongst them and the younger people know they need change."

"In all this, we are talking about the male priesthood, not about the Mothers that make the other branch of government. We have not focused so much on them for several reasons. Mothers act more strongly on the local level, in towns and cities, are more numerous and have a less defined hierarchy. Their organization is bottom-up while the priests' is top-down. This means that by dealing with a few priests high in the hierarchy we may influence the whole priesthood. We can't do that with the Mothers, their organization is much too diffuse."

Noticing some uneasiness in the audience, he added, "I know, ladies, it all sounds very sexist but it is not my fault, that's the way things are and, we believe, they are ripe for change. Anyway, it is better than it was before, I mean, before the Great War. Part of Elvar's reform was to grant women, or rather, mothers, a place of privilege which, of course, now seems even offensive towards some of them but, at that point, granting women the resources to have children and see them grow old in peace was what they needed, what the whole world needed. Their society has grown beyond the point where survival is an issue. Society, nowadays, offers more roles both to women and men, but the laws and their culture makes it hard for them to fulfill them. But let me carry on with my notes", he added while waving the papers he had in his hand.

"There is another, far more practical reason for us to contact the priesthood: they own Pinnacle, and we need access to Pinnacle to finally establish the link in between our two worlds. That is the key to ensure our survival. And it is also the key for both our worlds to flourish."

"As we speak, we expect a local we have contacted a couple of years ago to be on his way to 'discover' the anchor structure inside Pinnacle. He is a young and well placed faculty member at Pinnacle. We tried to make his 'discovery' seem accidental. Though, of course, our people amongst the locals know or will be told about the true nature of the structure, for the time being we don't want others to associate that structure with us. We believe the bare existence of the structure itself will be enough of a surprise. We don't want to push it too hard."

"So, this is a crucial point for us. If the more progressive people get to the top, as we think it will happen, we will be able to participate more openly in the changes this society needs, and we need to start working on them as soon as there is change at the top. We need to ride the wave of change, carry on with the momentum. We have studied the profiles of the candidates to be elected Supreme Priest. There is a small chance of a conservative backslash, fortunately, the two candidates that would embody it are old so, even if either of them get elected, we expect them to retire in a few years, at any rate, not a big loss. That would force us to back down until the next Conclave. The middle-of-the-road candidates are obviously majority, and they come in several flavors, too many for me to discuss them right now. And, of course, we have our favorite candidates and if any of them get elected, then we have to be ready to go full throttle. That is why we are here. If the right wave comes, we must be ready to ride it."

"Now, we will split into several groups and we'll go through the plans we have for each area. Plan A is the full throttle. We'll activate that one if the election falls on one of our candidates. Some of you have a plan B which is a more modest one. If things don't go our way, we will just carry on as we are doing right now. So, please guys, stand up", he said pointing to 5 people in the front row, "I believe most of you know them. They'll be leading the separate groups to discuss the different plans for each area. They will call the people each will meet in the first round until the meal. For those that will not take part in any of these, you are free until mealtime. Feel free to go listen to the birds sing and the wind blow through the leaves or whatever the heck people are supposed to do in a spiritual retreat. Fioni, you go first, call the people on your list and then you call yours and so on", he said pointing to the man next to her. "Then, we can all go for a pee-break and start our separate meetings. Anisia, please, you come with me."

"Hi Anisia, nice to see you again. I've heard you are doing fine."

"Hi Anric, nice to see you too. I am doing fine, thank you. This was quite unexpected, what am I doing here?"

"That's what I wanted to talk to you about, first of all to apologize for the surprise."

"Well, I know I am part of a sort of secret society, the mother of all secret societies, we have our own planet!"

"Sounds cool, doesn't it?"

"Yeah, right, as if I had any choice. Anyway, when Baria first told me to go pack and get ready to leave ASAP I said, 'are we going to kidnap someone?'. I meant it as a joke but then, I though, are we? What's all those Plan As and Plan Bs?"

"We are not kidnapping or forcing anyone into anything, not even you though it might seem you don't have an option. The fact is that we didn't have time to ask you and that is what I am doing right now. You see, all of us here knew what we were getting into. Baria knows that the purpose of her publishing house is for us to propagate progressive ideas that can benefit us and, at this stage, if everything goes according to plan get the 'futurists', as we call them, to meet and turn them into a force for change. She agreed to that and she is doing great. We haven't asked you. You were not in our plans but a couple of things came up and you seem to be the perfect person to do them. We decided to bring you here without asking you before to save time. If you accept, we'll assign you to that, if you don't, you return home and nothing is lost."

"Well, I accepted your offer, I made a new life here and I'm very grateful for that".

"Yes, but that is all we agreed to and you have also been very helpful. We needed someone to nominally own your factory and to work in it. We are even on that. Now we are going to ask you to go beyond that and, I'm afraid, it will imply exposing yourself. You, as most of us, are living on false identities with fake papers and histories. We always keep a low profile so we don't risk detection. We try not to expose our people but things can go wrong. If that happens, your current identity might be compromised. You might even end up in jail. This was not part of the deal we offered you. That is why I have to ask you whether you agree to be part of it."

"There is no way I could possibly say no, even though you are scaring me. I know we are always on the edge of disaster up in Heaven. I can't be so selfish. Of course I will help, you can count on me."

"Good, thanks Anisia. I was sure you would accept. I told you the worst that can happen. We don't expect that to happen. I don't know who will tell you about your assignment, but it will be after the meal so, right now, you are free to go and listen to the birds singing."

"I prefer the murmur of the clear spring water running over the pebbles."

"Oh, yes, that one. I see you are well acquainted with these matters. Well, thank you, Anisia."

"My pleasure, Anric".

"Stop looking at your bag, it is not going anywhere", said Baria in a low voice to Anisia sitting by her side on the train back home. "It seems you never had a portable transmitter before".

"I know, it is silly, I have used plenty of those without a second thought up in Heaven but here it feels such an important thing".

"Well, it is important, they placed a relay satellite in orbit around Mother for you."

"Not just for me, there was another insomniac and about a dozen people during the day."

"Then, take it easy, if you share the satellite then you are half as important. Anyway, what do you think about getting Fania on board?"

"I think it is fantastic. I feel very close to her situation. You know the troubles that got me exiled to Mother. Now that I've got used to Mother, I can't imagine living in Heaven anymore. No wonder I got into drugs, I needed to escape from that."

"I listen to what you say, but I can't say I understand what you felt back then. I missed home a lot when they sent me here but then, I met Jon back at the Farm and we are very happy together here, but we wouldn't mind returning home. You see, I still refer to Heaven as home."

"Sure, I know, for some people it is just fine, for others, it is not, and I feel the same goes for Fania. She would be so much happy if she could fly away from Mother!"

"Not just with her imagination?"

"Oh, no, space travel is not just a fantasy for her. You have plenty of writers in your magazine, for most of them placing their heroes in a spaceship is just as good as having them sailing over the ocean. Heaven might be populated with either gods or vampires, it is all the same. For them, and their readers, it is mostly escapism. It is not like that with Fania, she really knows how life in space or other planets can be, of course, within the limitations of what she had learned, which is plagued with errors and misconceptions. She feels at home in space while down here, she is a college dropout, who used to work in packaging and other menial tasks before that. She simply doesn't fit down here."

"Just like you."

"Sort of, but the other way around."

"So, are you going to take her to Pinnacle?"

"Sure, Anric approved it so, why not?"

"Right, why not!"
