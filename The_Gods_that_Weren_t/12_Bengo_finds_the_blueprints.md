# 12 - Bengo finds the Blueprints

"Master Allucio, Master Allucio, please!", called Bengo as soon as he entered the library. Allucio was surprised to see him so excited. Perhaps this was to be expected from a junior librarian in his first quasi-independent research job. His initials were in a few dozen new library cards, which should count for something in his line of business, but it wasn't so for Allucio who had not found what he came looking for. It had been a dozen or more sessions of looking at and examining hundreds of mostly worthless documents in the hope to find those drawings he recalled from long ago or a chance to slip in the fakes he had with him. So far he hadn't succeeded in neither of those goals. Since there was still so much to go through, he expected the chance to get the fakes in the remaining set so they would eventually show up. He had agreed to help with the cataloging and it wouldn't be right to back out of that deal, but the payoff he had expected hadn't come. What might have made Bengo so happy?

"Master Allucio, do you remember all the material we found in the room, all those packages along yours belonging to several departments, half forgotten? We, that is, the Librarian and myself, wrote notes reminding each of them that they had documents here and three of them sent for their stuff and at least one of them actually looked into it because they even returned a cardboard tube with a bunch of architectural drawings, or so they say they are."

"And they returned them?", exclaimed Allucio surprised, that would be a first, one department letting go of whatever they could put their hands on, they must have run out of space.

"It was Philosophy". Bengo got the keys and followed Allucio to their work room.

"I see," acknowledged Allucio, "anything good in them?"

"I haven't seen them, I waited for you and, besides, we had lots of visitors."

"The Conclave?".

"Indeed, we have already taken the Twelve Notebooks to the East Hall as we do on most major holidays, but visitors still want to see this or that, and it all takes so much time. Just the welcoming, the tour, the farewells, all that protocol, the most senior they are, the longer it takes."

"As I should well know", said Allucio stopping and turning to look Bengo eye to eye.

Bengo's eyes widened as he realized he was talking to a quite senior member of the Order, even if relatively young. "Sorry sir, I meant ..."

Allucio raised his hand to stop Bengo's explanation, which was unlikely to do any good. "I know what you mean and I've suffered my own share of pompous grandstanding myself, plus I had to move out of my quarters. I just have to remind you of your position for your own benefit. It is not wise for a junior member to talk in that way about his superiors."

"Yes sir, thank you sir, I'm sorry to hear that, about your place, I mean," said Bengo who probably kept his sleeping place, modest as it probably was. Allucio simply moved to the Observatory, where he used to spend the nights anyway, so it wasn't really that bad, except for the long walks up and down in the heat of the day.

It was a tradition that the Supreme Priest, the High Priest of Pinnacle, the _primus inter pares_ retired at some point after 70. The announcement was usually done in the service to commemorate the death of Elvar, the Supreme Priest who brought the world back from the Great Collapse. It was not a written rule, but when a Supreme Priest reached 68, speculations flourished and, it was rumored, bets were taken on whether the announcement would come and when it would happen, as the High Priest usually gave one or two years advance notice. The Supreme Priest was the only one elected in a conclave of all the High Priests of Mother plus the Great Mother, the head of the Council of Mothers. The election required two thirds majority and no veto from neither the retiring Supreme Priest nor the Great Mother or four fifths majority, which could not be vetoed. If a positive result was not reached after ten voting rounds, a new Conclave was to meet a year after as long as there was a Supreme Priest in office. If the Supreme Priest died or was otherwise incapacitated, the Conclave could not adjourn until a decision was taken. The record had been 5 years until the Supreme Priest died which forced a 4 day Conclave. Though that was long before anyone still living was born, nobody in Pinnacle wanted to go through that.

"So, what do we have?"

Benjo opened the door and pointed to the table, where a cardboard tube now lay. They both got their working frocks and gloves on. The tube was in good shape. Taking the cap off, they looked at the contents and the sheets looked in good condition to be handled. Allucio took the tube and tilted it down to let the contents slide onto Bengo's arms, who placed the bundle on the table and, while Allucio held the ends, began unrolling it.

It soon became apparent that they had struck gold. They started leafing through the corner with the title blocks. Each drawing was dated in the old system and those dates corresponded to the Great War. They were marked 'Most Secret', which made them even rarer, since most such documentation had been burned to avoid capture. The Great War, the war with no victor, ended with no side able to profit from capturing anything from the other side. The owner of the drawings was identified but neither Allucio nor Bengo could recognize which side it corresponded to since the names of the warring parties were barely mentioned in history classes and seldom remembered, being all of them more or less the same and equally irrelevant. The titles themselves offered little help since they referred to 'project this' or 'project that' and then the title of the particular view, which didn't provide a clue about what the overall project might have been. There seemed to be three separate projects. Bengo was already taking notes of all this for the index cards he was bound to write for the catalog.

It was time to look at the drawings themselves. The whole set was flat on the table, held by the small sandbags in their corners. The drawings covered most of the table in the room, there was no extra space to put the top drawing to uncover the one below. With so many visitors, there was no question about using the general reading room nor any other private room; they were lucky they still had the one they were using!

"Let me check if the folding table is available, I think we can fit it here if we move the desk to that side", said Bengo and a few minutes later he came in with the table. They both carefully moved the desk with the drawings to one side, took the chairs and the coat hanger out and brought the extra table in and unfolded it. It did fit, but barely, and they could hardly move about.

The first set of drawings showed something of a monumental scale, if the dimensions were to be trusted, a conical structure, much like a volcano but slender, twice as high than wide, about 30 stories tall, made of a series of bowed columns bulging inwards, joined by rings at regular intervals, all sprouting from a massive solid circular base two stories high, half buried into the ground, itself nailed further down with several dozen pylons inserted all the way to the bedrock. The whole structure was located in an otherwise featureless plain or, possibly at a place to be determined since the location showed all zeros for both fall and azimuth.

The second set was far more shocking. It was a similar structure but its location was all too familiar not least because the city by its side was clearly labeled Pinnacle City. The city was there, the line of the coast, the port and the High Temple, though, it would seem an earlier, smaller one. Pinnacle itself looked quite different. It was much shorter, its top being an ample esplanade on top of which, the enormous structure sat. The coast was not quite the same either, Pinnacle looked like an island joined by a causeway to the continent, not the peninsula it currently was. The structure also had a difference with that on the first set; way up, on the sea side, it had a ledge which Allucio immediately recognized as the one where his Observatory was located.

Allucio was exultant, this was not what he had been looking for, that drawing he briefly saw years ago, but it was infinitely better. However, when he saw the confusion in Bengo's face, he wondered if it would be prudent to show it, perhaps showing a mild surprise might be in order.

"What do you make out of this?", he asked Bengo so as to gauge how he could proceed.

"Well, it seems to be Pinnacle, sir, it is labeled so", said Bengo while pointing to the label inside the crosshatch that marked the city, "the coast there seems to be missing the promenade, but that should be no surprise since it is relatively new. Cape Farsi stands out clearer off the coast, with the promenade and all the new construction on the coast missing. The port, of course, is where it is now, the piers are more or less there, this one is shorter, it might have been lengthened after this drawing. The sand beach on the sea side of this breakwater is missing, it might have been newly built then and it had not been silted yet. As to that, sir", he said while pointing to the Pinnacle itself, "I don't know what to make of it, it is in the proper location, but it is completely different".

Allucio was surprised at Bengo's exposition, it seemed as he had switched modes into the student reciting a lesson. It was clear that Bengo took them quite seriously. It seemed fair that Allucio should contribute his part.

"Well, if we assume that all things got silted just as this breakwater here", said Allucio pointing to the drawing, "it appears the same might have happened with Pinnacle. The base of the peninsula was a causeway back then. All the buildings, such as the Library itself, were build on ground gained to the sea. If we were standing here, in those days we would be with the water up to our necks!"

"Pinnacle looks more like an island connected to the coast by a road than the tip of a peninsula", continued Allucio. "Its contour looks more artificial, perhaps the original Pinnacle was protected by a man-made breakwater that also got silted and built over. The kitchens and the dock for the supplies should be about here, shouldn't they?"

"Yes sir, lots of buildings at the base of Pinnacle are missing", replied Bengo.

"But, and this is a great 'but', the top of Pinnacle itself is missing", Allucio said finally. Bengo clearly relaxed at hearing this, evidence that he saw it but didn't dare to state it out loud. "I would be as bold as to say that Pinnacle, the whole of it, is artificial!"

Bengo looked straight at him, wide eyed. Pinnacle was sacred ground, wasn't it? Allucio knew that Bengo was not particularly religious but, anyway, this was a touchy issue which Bengo had avoided in his so eloquent description of the drawings, his description of the coastline, the various physical features, the port, they were all very clear and solid, but he had refrained from saying anything about Pinnacle, afraid he might say something inappropriate. Thus, it was Allucio who had to say it, to put it out of the way.

"Bengo, it does not escape me that this might have religious implications, which we will undoubtedly have to deal with along with other people more knowledgeable in that area, but we cannot deny what we are looking at. Perhaps Pinnacle existed and these drawings are part of a plan to blast the top off and build something in what remained, perhaps it was one of so many insane plans they had in those days and has no reality at all or, perhaps, Pinnacle indeed is artificial. We don't know yet, we are just describing what these drawings show. After all, how are we going to fill the index card for the catalog?"

"The index card!", exclaimed Bengo, "I'll have to check with the Librarian on this one!"

"That is just for starters, we will have to check this with lots of people! But before we do that, lets study them a little more. See this platform here? That is where the Observatory is built, the elevation is more or less correct, I'm not sure if these elevations are relative to the mean sea level or some other reference point, but it is barely one meter short of the 97 meters I know the Observatory to be, not a big difference. Can we check other details to try to assess its credibility?"

"Do you know the total height of Pinnacle, otherwise, I can go and look for it."

"No, I know the Observatory because I work there, the total height seems right, in proportion, but I don't have the exact value in my mind."

"I'll go and look for it."

"No, wait, I have a better idea, please come with me. Can we close this place for a while? I guess we can be back in half an hour".

And so, they went to the High Temple to look at the mosaic of that former temple that Allucio had seen a few days earlier.

"Now, Bengo, what do you think of this mosaic, doesn't it look much like the Pinnacle of the drawings without, of course, the strange structure?"

"It does, sir, it very much does."

"As with most other images in the Temple, this was probably thought as more symbolic than realistic, specially since the whole place seemed quite out of scale, Pinnacle looked too short and wide. Probably everybody thought the artist meant to highlight the Temple and that's why everything else looked so small. There you can see Elvar towering over the rest of the priests even though we know that he was barely above average height for his time."

"We have a book with all these mosaics in the Library, I checked it out a couple of days ago and it should be back by now, perhaps we can see if this image fits the drawings."

"Great idea! Shall we go back then?"

They split when they arrived at the Library, Bengo went to check out the art book, Allucio straight to their room. He was very relieved to find these drawings, the second one was almost the same as one of the fakes he had, making them all quite irrelevant. These were originals and Bengo had found them. Slipping in the fakes would only create trouble because they were slightly different. The aging of the paper and the ink, the data in the title block, they had all been faked in a very credible way, but if you placed the two together it would put into question both versions. He would have to destroy the fakes.

He had his gloves and apron on and was putting some order to the drawings and making space when Bengo arrived with the book.

"Put it here, Bengo, I placed the view from above right here, it is the one that best shows the floor plan of the Temple, at least its contour."

Allucio looked at the two drawings while Bengo donned his gloves and apron.

"Bengo, I think this is it. Look at the three joined hexagonal blocks of the temple connected by the esplanade and the steps coming out to the road, the balcony of the central building over the esplanade. The crosshatch on the drawing doesn't give us many clues about the building, just the area it occupies, nothing about the height or decoration, but it looks like we have a good match. What height would you think those doors are?"

"Hard to say, they could be anything, if we assume the height is similar to the current temple, it would be 2.5 meters or thereabouts. This book also has an image of the current temple, let me see."

After looking at the table of contents and browsing a few pages Bengo found it, not in the exact same angle or span, but close enough. Going back and forth in between the current and the old Temple, they checked the proportions of them.

"Look at the steps, you can't make steps of any random height, people, old people, still need to be able to climb so we can assume the height of each step is the same and the doors in both temples seem to be the same, in proportion to the height of the steps."

"So, if we assume the height of the door to be 2.5 meters, lets check the width of the building. May I touch it?", asked Allucio.

"Yes sir, this is one of several copies, you don't even need gloves to handle that book."

So, Allucio took a blank card and laid it over the book with an edge along the center of the door and the corner of the card reaching the top. Then he made a pencil mark at the bottom of the card. Bengo said he was going for a ruler. As Allucio starting to count how many times that height fitted in the width of the building, he realized Bengo's idea was much better so he gave up.

When Bengo came, they did all the measurements of the parts of the drawing they thought they could identify in the mosaic in the Temple and, within reason, they seemed to match. Then, they went a little further. Pinnacle was behind the temple and the perspective seemed a little forced, but they wondered how high the plateau on top of the shortened Pinnacle behind the Temple seemed to be and, likewise, how wide the esplanade seemed, all in relation to the height of the Temple itself, which they measured relative to the door, which they guessed might be about 2.5 meters high. Once again, accepting the crudeness of their approach, they all seemed to match.

"May I call the Librarian, Master Allucio?"

"You might, but I think you won't find him, nor will you find me in a couple of minutes", said Allucio while taking his gloves off, "it is meal time and with so many honored guests, we are all running on a tight schedule. I have my formal gown down at Master Enuas' office, to avoid running up to the Observatory, were I'm living right now, but I'll still have to run or risk getting late. I've never been good with the smalltalk required in these occasions but with all of this in my mind, I'll really hate going through all that babbling. Anyway, I'll try to have a word with the Librarian and we may meet later on, possibly after the nap."

"That would be great, sir, I'll take care of putting some order here. I'm always around in the Library these days, with most courses suspended for the duration."

"Good, with or without the Librarian, I'll came back after the nap. Thank you, Bengo".

"Thank you, sir, and enjoy your meal."

----

Allucio was thinking about whether telling the Librarian or not. He wasn't sure how to handle the discovery, perhaps he could gather more information and have irrefutable evidence, but what would that evidence have to be? On the other hand, since he told Bengo he would tell the Librarian, how could he either fool him or turn him into an accomplice? No, waiting didn't seem to be an answer. Then the question would have to be how to present the information they have found. He knew the structure was the anchor of the cable linking Heaven and Mother, but he didn't need to say so. Marlo and Jobas only asked him to discover the structure which didn't require him to explain its purpose.

He also found something else, though it took a while for him to realize it. The other set of drawings of a similar structure were for the equivalent at the other end of the cable, the one on Heaven. Those zeros for the fall and azimuth in the drawing weren't placeholders for values that were yet to be determined, no, the structure was meant to be at zero fall, zero azimuth, just like Pinnacle was. Drawings of something to be built on Heaven! He didn't even know, until recently, that Heaven could be reached, much less that you could live, work and build things on it!

"Master Allucio!" he heard and on turning saw the Librarian coming to him, "on my way here Bengo told me you found something interesting to show me. He seemed quite excited."

"Yes, indeed, Librarian", replied Allucio who felt relieved the decision had been taken off his shoulders.

"I'll be at the Library after the short nap and so will Bengo. Unless something, or someone, shows up -and with all these visitors you never know- you can show me what you've found at any time."

"I'll be there, thank you, Librarian".

"So, lets go and take our seats, and pray for decent company", the Librarian said as he left.

With so many high ranking priests, Allucio had been bumped off the main table and ended up seated along the retinue of a couple of the visiting priests. The company changed at every meal and his position at the table and that of his companions changed as they got bumped further and further away. A second shift had been established because, though seating space could be easily arranged, the kitchens were already running at full capacity. The younger had been bumped to a second shift and Allucio wondered if they weren't the ones getting the best deal with no elders inhibiting their spirits. This time, however, Allucio's company was good, the talk easy and interesting. He hoped they would remain together in later meals. The Conclave would start with the meal after the midday eclipse, which meant almost everybody had arrived and there would not be much further changes in seating. Another piece of good news was that a junior colleague of one of his table mates was an insomniac. He ate in the second shift so they would tell him to come before the next meal so they could introduce him. He had feared one of the visiting High Priests might be an insomniac and that he might be forced to keep him company as it had been the case a few years back. Fortunately, the only insomniac visiting High Priest was almost a hermit during the day so the last thing he wanted during the night was company.

----

Allucio went to the Library after the nap. Bengo saw him arrive and signaled towards the office of the Librarian.

"Good day, Master Allucio, the Librarian asked me to tell him when you arrived."

"Good day, Bengo, please, ask him if I may see him."

"Good day everyone", said the Librarian coming out of the office. "There is a sort of excitement in the air, so, why don't we all go and see what you have for me?"

"Yes, of course Librarian, Bengo, do you have the keys?"

"Yes, sir, allow me to go ahead and open the room".

With so little room inside, Bengo opened the door and remained outside to let the Librarian and Allucio in. Allucio got the gloves and started with the art book with the mosaic of the old temple.

"This image is from a mosaic on one of the walls in the High Temple, over the frieze and bound by the semicircular arch above. It shows an image of an earlier Temple presumably at the same site as the current one. As with many of the old images, the perspective is somewhat forced, the artists in those days went back to the tradition of making the size of the elements in proportion to their importance. Elvar the Pacifier is consistently shown towering over the rest. For ages, it has been assumed that this image had the Temple drawn much larger than the background, in this case, Pinnacle. That is why Pinnacle looks so small, almost ridiculously so."

"Bengo recently brought these drawings that had been misplaced and luckily returned to us, that would seem to show the image is right, not distorted at all, or not that much anyway", said Allucio while putting the art book aside and pointing at the drawings. He had decided to reach the structure last, avoiding any speculation about what it might be. He meant to validate the other elements of the drawing first. The floor plan they were now looking at didn't show the amazing height of the structure but it clearly showed the geography of the surrounding area.

"As you can see in this view, the area occupied by the earlier Temple is represented by a crosshatch. The details, such as the main blocks that made the temple or the steps reaching the esplanade and then those to the entrances match what we see here. We estimated the size and proportions and they seem correct. Yes, Bengo", said Allucio upon seeing Bengo raise a finger calling for attention.

"If I may, sir, I did those measurements again after you left, sir, since I have the second shift, and checked some other features that can be deduced from that crosshatch against those in the art book and they all match quite well."

"Ah!, thank you, Bengo, well done. So, the point is, the crosshatch in this drawing corresponds to the building shown in this mosaic. We also checked other features in the drawing that are not shown in the mosaic, such as the coastline. We know the promenade is recent and is not shown here. Cape Farsi looks as we could expect it was back then."

"Not so long ago, gentlemen, I've seen Cape Farsi with about that shape with my own eyes since the promenade was built in several stages and Cape Farsi was built over when I was a boy. I played there, you know, I was born in the city. The promenade reached about here in those days", said the Librarian while pointing towards the drawing. So, yes, I can see the coast is quite correct, and so is the port. My grandfather worked in the extension of this pier here. Pinnacle, though, doesn't look like anything I've ever seen".

"Indeed, sir, and it is far more different than we could imagine", said Allucio while unrolling the drawing with the side view. "Here, it seems, is Pinnacle as we may assume it might have been back then".

"But, what is this?", exclaimed the Librarian pointing to the artificial structure were Pinnacle should be.

"We don't know, sir. If we leave the strange structure out, the ground it is built upon seems to match what we see of Pinnacle in this mosaic. You can see, it would seem that the artist doing the mosaic did not force the perspective at all, the Pinnacle he drew was real. We tried to measure it just as we did with the temple and it also matches", said Allucio looking at Bengo and signaling him to speak.

"I also checked those measurements, sir, and, indeed, they match more or less though, since they are on a second plane, the margin for error is greater."

Since the Librarian remained silent, Allucio ventured, "We don't know what that structure might be. Since the drawing is marked 'Most Secret', we might assume it has some military purpose or, at least 'strategic', as I believe they called important projects back then. We don't know if they planed to build that on top of a much shorter Pinnacle or they planed on carving the top of Pinnacle out, shortening it to the level shown there. Then, there is this mosaic here, that shows a shorter Pinnacle with no extra artificial structures on top, just an ample esplanade."

The Librarian looked at one and the other several times. "Can you unfold the floor plan again, please, I don't have my gloves on".

"Certainly, sir", said Allucio rolling the side view out of the way.

After a while in silence, the Librarian breathed deeply and said, "I agree, lets leave the structure aside for a while, it might be one of those deranged projects of those days we don't even want to know about. Pinnacle, though, looks quite different to what it is now, not just shorter but clearly artificial."

He continued, "As I mentioned, I was born and grew up here. When the promenade reached Cape Farsi I remember they had to stop for a while because of some ruins they found. For a while I played in those ruins with other kids until they put a fence around it. Some said it had been the High Temple before Pinnacle was built. That was an expression often used in those days, 'before Pinnacle was built'. Not 'the Temple at Pinnacle was built', no, they said 'Pinnacle was built'. They used that expression to refer to anything old enough as existing since before 'Pinnacle was built'."

"Bengo, may I borrow your gloves?" The Librarian donned the gloves and started to browse through the drawings . "Well, what do you make of this?"

"The coastline of Pinnacle looks too well rounded, it does seem artificial. It does not look like a peninsula but an artificial island joined to the mainland by a causeway, which you can see here", said Allucio pointing to one of the drawings. "We can assume that just as the breakwaters around the port got silted and grew to their current extension, so did the causeway and the island. In both cases, that space was used for buildings such as this one. As far as I can tell, we are standing here, with the water up to our necks, according to this drawing", added Allucio pointing to a place a few meters off the breakwater surrounding Pinnacle.

"More like floating in mid-air", agreed the Librarian, "but what do you think of the structure on top?"

"If the drawings were not marked 'Most Secret', I might believe it might have some religious purpose, after all, we build our temples high to reach towards Heaven. If the point closest to Heaven is in the water, not far away from the coast, it makes sense to build a pier to reach it and put a temple there. To do that, you have to build an island. Those ruins in Cape Farsi you mentioned, Librarian, indicate that we had already tried reaching closer to Heaven by going into the sea. At some point they realized Cape Farsi was not the correct location and build an island here. In the quest to go ever higher, given that there are limits to how tall we can make a building, an alternative is to raise the ground and build over that. Perhaps that was the intent of this esplanade here, behind the Temple."

"Could this structure be such temple?", asked the Librarian. His voice made it clear that he didn't like the idea at all. "Tall, it is, but it is horrid!".

"I don't think so. First of all, I doubt the plans for a new temple would be marked secret. Then, there is the thickness of this slab of concrete at the base of those columns, I am no expert in the matter, but it seems too heavy to me, as if it was meant to support something much, much heavier than the columns we see. The slab has vertical steel rods spread all over which protrude half a meter and form a loop, as the eye of a needle. What were they meant to hold? They were afraid people would steal the pews?"

"Well, you know what happened to Elvar's chair!", joked the Librarian. As Bengo looked disconcerted while they laughed, he explained, "Bengo, it seems you don't know the story. Elvar's chair there in the Temple has been rebuilt out of parts recovered from the original and new pieces added. It had been stolen and was being broken and the splinters sold as relics. Can you imagine, people buying a piece of wood because Elvar's Holy Ass sat on it?"

"Well, not so absurd, sir, if we keep the whole chair center stage in the Temple because Elvar sat on it", added Allucio.

"True, quite true. Such fools we all are." After the laughter subsided, he added, "So, lets go back to the structure. You think it was meant to hold some sort of machinery?"

"Quite possibly, yes. There are other details", added Allucio while browsing through the drawings trying to locate one of them, "see this ledge here? The location, on the sea side of Pinnacle, and the height match the place where the Observatory is."

"Wait a minute, you mean this has actually been build?"

"I can't be certain of that, sir, but it is a possibility."

"But Pinnacle is a mountain!, well a hill anyway, all rocks and trees".

"Yes, sir, it certainly looks like that, but this can still be within. All the rocks, the soil and the vegetation that grows in it might have been added. If this is a military project, it might have been meant as camouflage. Yes Bengo."

"If you excuse me, sir, I thought about it being camouflage and it doesn't make a lot of sense. Pinnacle is huge and it stands out so clearly above the horizon that there is no way to ignore it is there and if, at some point, a short and wide esplanade, as it is shown in the mosaic, grows into a high and narrow hill as it currently is, it is hard to believe someone could be fooled by a few trees. Hills just don't grow on their own." Seeing that both his seniors nodded approvingly, Bengo continued, "I remembered a visit to my aunt's place. Many of the old houses in the town are abandoned ammunition magazines. They used to store explosives there. They were half buried vaults with doors at each end, and they were covered in soil. Like artificial caves dug in the ground. The soil on top was meant to dampen the explosions either of the explosives inside, if anything went wrong, or of enemy shells falling on them. They were empty when some wandering group of refugees found them after the Great War, my ancestors amongst them. Some say the pond in the middle of the town was one of those magazines that blew up. A large pond, sir."

"You mean that Pinnacle might be full of explosives?", asked the Librarian.

"Well, not necessarily sir. The soil over the magazine is also meant to protect the contents from bombardment. Perhaps the soil covering Pinnacle was meant to protect whatever is inside. And the soil needs vegetation, otherwise the rain and the wind washes it away. In my aunt's town, everyone living in one of the magazines tends their gardens on their roofs to keep the soil in place. On hillsides as steep as here on Pinnacle, you also need deep-rooted trees"

"Like in the banks of the canals", added Allucio.

"Indeed, sir".

"I don't think there are explosives inside, sir", added Allucio. "Do those magazines have concrete floors?"

"No, sir, they had hard packed soil, and some still have it, they are amazingly clean and dry."

"So, we can assume that explosives don't need neither this thick slab of concrete to support them nor these huge, lets call them nails, to hold them in place".

"No, sir, they don't, none of the magazines had anything but plain packed soil in their floors when they were first occupied."

"So, sir, I think we can safely assume that the structure is meant to house some sort of machinery and the soil piled around it to protect it", concluded Allucio.

"That makes me feel much safer, gentlemen, there might be a diabolical weapon in there, but no explosives. This is not going to improve my digestion. Pinnacle blowing up in the middle of a Conclave, with all the High Priests gathered right at its footstep. Some might say it would improve things, I can think of one or two of them ... Anyway, whatever it is, if there is anything, it hasn't made a murmur in all these centuries. There has been dozens of Conclaves, I don't think we have anything to fear. However, we don't even know if the structure is there and, if it is, whether it contains anything".

"No, sir, we don't".

"So, Master Allucio, before going any further, could you confirm what do we have here? Without blowing up anything, please".

"Yes, sir".

"Discreetly".

"Yes, sir".
