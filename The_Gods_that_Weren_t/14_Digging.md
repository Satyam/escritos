# 14 - Digging

Night was approaching and the Conclave had not picked a new High Priest yet. The 'experts' said there would be no voting at this point as there were plenty of ceremonies to perform immediately after the election and there would be no time for them so late in the day. There would be plenty more wheeling and dealing ahead but no voting.

Allucio had been busy gathering equipment for his archaeological expedition, or so he called it. Getting the tools was a simple affair though carrying each up the hill wasn't. He believed there was a door leading from the inside of the structure within Pinnacle to the platform where the Observatory was located or at least that is what he understood from the drawings which he kept studying with Bengo at the Library. That door was covered in dirt and possibly some rocks and it might be sealed so he had to plan for several alternatives. He decided on that door because the Observatory was his domain and nobody would question whatever he did up there. Also because the earthen cover was thinner up there. At the bottom, not only was there more soil piled up with trees and gardens but there were also buildings leaning against Pinnacle.

Normally, he lived downhill during the day, with the occasional visit to the Observatory while he remained mostly uphill during the night. Since he had to lend his lodgings downhill for a visiting High Priest, he was forced to continuously go up and down the hill to his small room up at the Observatory. Fortunately, he was able to share part of the work. Bengo was quite busy at the Library and whatever free time he had it was better used in studying the drawings. The help had arrived from an unexpected corner. His table mates had introduced to him a young student, Ferbin, an insomniac like him, that had come as a junior assistant to one of the High Priests and, being so young, he wasn't even allowed in the sessions of the Conclave so, while the High Priests were meeting, he was free. No one on his delegation was an insomniac so he was facing a very long and boring night in a foreign place and the idea of participating in what he believed to be an archaeological expedition was the best plan he had so far. Not only did he help in carrying the tools uphill, he said he was a good cook. He had partly paid his studies working in a restaurant where he learned a good deal of the trade. Allucio had become used to the jars of ready-to-eat meals the kitchen used to prepare for him, but they were overwhelmed with so many visitors and had no time to prepare them for this night. Ferbin volunteered to do the cooking and, prior to that, to get all they needed, Allucio only had to get him cleared with the guy in charge of the stores.

The Observatory had plenty of room for Allucio and now, Ferbin, plus their equipment and stores. Some they left outside under a tarpaulin. Ferbin was also cooking and putting in jars the meals for later in the night, when they had run out of fresh food. Allucio was often welcomed by the aromas of Ferbin's cooking, an encouraging sign for the later meals. At present, as a host, he had to take his meals at the refectory, where the standards have gone down due to the number of visitors. Recently hot dishes reached him barely tepid. He was really looking forward for night to come.

He excused himself from the last meal of the day. It was not a formal meal, it couldn't be since some sleepers got drowsy earlier than others so you could never predict who would be there. Of course, Allucio, being an insomniac had no such problem so he told his table mates in advance. He wanted to make an observation right at dusk, which was dawn at zero fall on Heaven. He didn't have much hope of seeing anything, the atmospheres of both planets would be bright, every spec of dust floating in the air shining in the sun. A simple calculation made it clear that his telescope didn't have the resolution to actually see it, but he still wanted to try. He meant to see the structure on Heaven, the twin of Pinnacle. He knew that it would be impossible to see the structure itself but he hoped to see the shade it projected on the surrounding ground, and the shadows were the longest at either dawn or dusk, and he meant to try both. He would be alone since Ferbin had to be down, with his delegation.

Being the last one staying awake Ferbin would help finish anything pending. In hectic situations such as the Conclave, clerks would often tie themselves to the back of their chairs to avoid falling with their faces on the piece of document they were trying hard to finish up and smearing the ink on their own work so he would have to untie them and lay them down. It also meant that Allucio would not need to give him any explanation of what he was looking at.

Allucio went through the routine of preparing the telescope though at a much earlier hour than he used to. It was still night at his target on Heaven but the terminator should not be far away. He decided to wait reclined as he was under the telescope. After a few minutes he started to see the ground turning bluish on the edge of his telescope, on the sunrise side of Heaven as the sunlight, diffused by the atmosphere, started to reach it. Then the direct sunlight started to hit the sunrise side of the range of short mountains delimiting the sunrise side of the valley where the structure was. The line of peaks was clearly defined as it formed the limit in between the lighted and shadowed sides. Then, the sun rays hit the bottom of the valley delineating the profile of the mountains on its surface, fuzzy at first but turning sharper as it approached the mountains themselves. But it had yet to reach the structure. At this point someone standing at the structure would see the dawn sky but not yet the sun, still hidden behind the mountains.

The mountains were about 900 meters over the valley floor which, according to his own previous study, was approximately 150 meters above sea level. The structure, according to the drawings, was about 70 meters over the valley floor and 50 meters wide at its base, narrowing to its top. He knew he was expecting a miracle, the shadow of such a small object could not be seen. He was hoping for some singular optical effect, a reflection perhaps, whatever that could prove its existence though he feared that whatever he saw, he would be deluding himself. Ancient charts of Heaven were full of such imagined sightings, the abodes of several gods being the most abundant. The moment had passed as he was thinking about this and nothing happened, no discernible shade, reflection or whatever he could have hoped for. He only proved his sanity. If he had seen anything, it could only have proved he was delirious.

He moved away from underneath the telescope and started to close it. He promised he would let Ferbin see through it, but the atmosphere was still too bright and, since they were going to do some digging, dust would start to fly, and that was not good for the mirrors. Then he took the wheelbarrow, a couple of shovels and a pickax from under the tarpaulin, out of the Observatory, to start working on the digging. Ferbin was just coming up the road.

"Good day, Master Allucio"

"Good day to you, Ferbin"

"I brought some food from the last shift at the refectory, shall I warm it up, sir?"

"Now that you mention it, yes, it would do me fine. Everything quiet down there?"

"Except for the fire watch doing their rounds, yes, everything was quiet."

A fireman from the city made sure the fires in the kitchen and the boiler room were doused and then checked the other buildings, mostly making sure no smoke came out of the chimneys. Several of his colleagues would do the same in the city itself, climbing to several high places or well placed roof tops looking for smoke or upward drafts coming out from chimneys.

"I'll start digging the first layer and then I'll join you."

"I'll call you when it is ready, sir."

----

They took a long nap after the meal, both were really tired from those hectic hours before the night fell. Allucio woke up first and was eating a piece of fruit while heating water for tea when Ferbin woke up. After their light breakfast, they went out to the dig. Allucio had mostly taken the green cover from a door-shaped area where he assumed the entrance might be found, the soil and a few small rocks were exposed.

"Where do you want to pile this dirt, sir?"

"I think we can move it there, I don't want the dirt to be anywhere near the telescope. I would dump it downslope and get rid of it but I fear we'll need it to cover this hole if we don't find anything."

Further digging the soil brought them to a pile of rocks about two palms wide each. This was encouraging because they had been more or less squared off and cleanly piled up. Unfortunately it brought another issue, how to take one out making sure the rest wouldn't fall down. Not being miners, they haven't thought about that. After a little discussion, they decided to widen the opening and see if there was something more solid. They started digging sideways, about waist high towards the left and they found a much larger rough boulder. They did the same on the other side and they found the same. The loose pile of round stones was about two meters wide with large boulders on each side. They started digging up and down and found the joint in between one boulder and the next and, to their surprise, there was mortar in between them. The large boulders on the sides leaned inwards and, as they kept digging up, they found they were joined by another horizontal slab about a meter wide with all the joints filled with mortar.

Still they had a ledge just short of a meter of soil on top of their heads, part of the earthen cover above the section that they had dug out, that could fall on them. It was held in place because of the roots and the natural cohesion of the moist soil, but if it started drying or if there was rain, it could fall off. The best they had to hold it was the step ladder they had been using and several shelfs they took out of a bookshelf. The ladder was slightly taller than the opening they had, but the last rung was just about right so, they put the shelves in between those rungs and started shaping the top of the opening so that those shelves would fit. Then they leaned the ladder so that the ends of the rails would pass under the opening and pushed it upwards while straightening it so that the end of the vertical beams would drive themselves into the dirt with a little help from the pickax. They placed bricks from an abandoned pile to fix the legs against the sides as the opening. They also laid a tarpaulin held by ropes to a couple of trees further up to prevent any rain from washing the loose soil down. It would not hold forever but, they hoped, if anything started moving, it would hold it long enough for them to escape.

There was a gap in between the horizontal slab that acted as a lintel and the round stones. They assumed that over the years the boulders might have settled down leaving that gap. They tried looking into it but the light of their lantern didn't reach far enough. They inserted a broomstick, after several attempts with shorter sticks, but they didn't hit anything. However, that told them the gap continued open for quite a while, and it went from side to side all the way.

There was nothing else to do but start removing the rounds stones. They started at the top. They would not be able to hold the boulder while standing up there so they had to let if fall and they didn't want it to hit the feet of the ladder so they started with the one right in the middle. With one on each side a couple of rungs up the ladder, bent under the shelves that held the roof, they started clearing the dirt around it and then using a couple of crowbars they pulled it out and let it fall. They went down and loaded it in the wheelbarrow and transported to the pile of debris. Then they went up for the second one, which went much easier, and then for the third one and so forth. They tried to open a gap to reach and take out a boulder further in so they could try the broomstick again and see if they could hit something. After much effort, when they were able to try the broomstick again, they were still unable to hit anything. By then, they were tired and starved so they stopped to have a meal.

Ferbin was as good a cook as he had promised, or at least it seemed so to Allucio who had been eating the dreadful food at the refectory these last few meals. He had been tempted to impose his seniority upon Ferbin and let him do the dishes but it didn't seem fair. Ferbin actually felt a little out of place allowing Allucio to do such a menial task and said he would do the dishes next time.

They had been talking about their discovery during the meal. The story Allucio had made up is that they had recently found some documents saying that a predecessor of his had built room under the peak of Pinnacle to run some sort of experiment, the nature of which was unknown as the documents were not complete. They had not been sure the room even existed. So far, they found an entrance but it might not lead anywhere, it might be no more than a dead-end tunnel.

Then they talked about the telescope. Allucio had shown it to Ferbin during the day but he had not watched the sky with it. Due to the dirt floating around, Allucio suggested that they try to finish clearing the entrance and, if that was not done by the midnight eclipse, they would stop working several hours ahead of the eclipse to let the dirt settle, and use it then. If it rained, that would also give them a good chance once it had stopped and the clouds moved away since it would clear the atmosphere. One way or another, he would have a chance.

----

They meant to keep digging in depth, like a wedge into the hillside, instead of opening a wide path. Their purpose was to look into whatever was at the other side and they might do that by simply crawling through a small opening. At least that was the plan according to the story Allucio had made up of a room that might have been build inside Pinnacle. Perhaps the room had never been built or it might be completely empty. In either case, their tunneling would suffice, it wouldn't make any sense to clear the whole tunnel to reach an empty room. Allucio expected to find something far larger than a room, but he wasn't ready to say that much, not yet.

After removing two further layers of boulders, they tried once again with the broomstick and this time they did hit something solid. The sound wasn't any different from hitting rock, perhaps it was a lintel that was lower than the rest. They could poke the stick all across the narrow gap in between the roof and the top boulders and the result was the same. Ferbin, who was the one who crawled into the hole, then tried to slide the stick from side to side and he found that whatever he was hitting at the end was not rough, as the rocks used in the lintels, but an even surface, either carved stone, cast mortar or plaster.

Their enthusiasm grew as they had some chance to change the drudgery of clearing the stones. But there was much to do ahead. The deeper the wedge they carved into the stone, the wider it got at the outside and the more boulders they had to move out of the way. Their bodies were aching, their hands bruised and they had banged their heads more times than they could remember.

Finally, after several meals, they reached whatever was at the end of the pile of boulders. They found that what they had hit was the lintel of a door frame cast in concrete. The door was of solid, thick metal. The first thing they found was the metal frame embedded into the concrete arch that they had hit first with the broomstick. It seemed to be a double door since they had found the union of the two panels. As they cleared their way to one side, they reached the hinge, which proved that, indeed, it was a door and that it opened outwards towards them. This presented a problem, they could not open it unless they cleared the rocks all the way down. Unless they could cut through it, but after several hits with the pickax, it seemed they would not be able to do that, it was too thick. Then there was the issue of which half opened first, at least that would spare them from clearing half the rocks. However, they figured out that was not true, in order to prevent the boulders from falling on them, they had to clear quite a lot of the other side as well so, if they missed in their choice of which side to clear first, in the end, it wouldn't make much difference.

----

The midnight eclipse was about to come so they didn't resume the clearance work after the meal before the eclipse. Allucio had kept all the vents closed to keep the dirt out so the telescope room was warm from the heat coming from the living area. He now opened all the vents to let the cool air come in so that the telescope and the air inside the room could settle to outside temperature. He would open the roof and uncover the mirrors at the last minute.

They were more than happy to do nothing. They were tired from doing a job they weren't used to. They got several bruises, specially doing the first row of boulders. Now, they were better at handling heavy weights but it was still tiring. Some relax was welcome. Ferbin went up to the very top and looked at the sea and Pinnacle City. Even with the lights out, the city was one of the largest in Mother and Ferbin wasn't used to anything so big. Since Heaven was right at the zenith, the sea shone all around. There was not a band of light over the sea in the direction of Heaven, as you could see in the sea anywhere else in Mother or on lakes and rivers. At Pinnacle, the sea shone in all directions. Allucio joined him for a while.

"Why is it there are some spots brighter than others? What's that dark patch over there?", asked Ferbin.

"That's because of the wind. The wind stirs the water and causes ripples on the surface. The slopes of those ripples reflect Heaven's light all around and some of those reflections hit your eyes. When you see a dark patch it is because there is no wind, the surface is calm so it reflects Heaven straight up, not in our direction."

"So it means the wind blows in patches, a little here, a little there, nothing there? I always though wind was wind all over. When there was wind, all the place got wind."

"Not so, and I tell you this not as a professor but as a sailor that I've been while I was a student. Boats use the wind when they can to save on fuel and it is important to catch a good wind. When you are steering, you don't want to get caught in one of those windless dark patches. On the other hand, sometimes you are in a nice patch, sailing easy with a nice breeze and you see a patch of very messy, choppy water coming fast towards you. That's the wind stirring the water and, when it gets so messy, it means the boat is going to lean badly when it hits you and, if it is strong enough, it might tear the canvas of your sails. You want to warn the rest of the crew and steer so that it doesn't hit you sideways. Anyway, it is harder to see the wind like this anywhere else than Pinnacle. This is the only spot in the whole of Mother where the sea shines all around and you can see the air currents all at once."

----

Allucio realized Ferbin was the first visiting insomniac he had. All the visitors he had before came during the day so it was a matter of showing the building and the telescope, making sure the brass had a good shine on it. You couldn't see anything during the day, except at the midday eclipse, and then Heaven was in complete darkness so there wasn't much to see there and sleepers, for some reason he couldn't understand, didn't care much for the stars. Many would have considered laying down on the observation seat and moved around on its cartwheels below their dignity. Usually, he would not even uncover the large mirror unless they specifically asked for that, it wasn't worth the potential damage to it.

Of course his department head had come several times for the midday eclipse but he was not a visitor and he had quite specific questions and places he wanted to observe. He now wondered whether those places had not been suggested to him by the lawyer who managed the endowment and was the contact with their benefactors, that is, the people from Heaven. He now wondered if his boss had not witnessed a light show as he was offered and later contacted. Might it be that his boss knew about the colonies in Heaven? He felt the telescope as his own and forgot others had used it even recently. Now that he thought about, there had been a couple of visitors, one just looked around with the wheels disengaged, moving the instrument at random and stopping here and there. He remembered that one because he had been on alert the whole time, less his visitor carelessly banged the telescope against the sides, specially when looking at the edge of Heaven and the stars beyond. He had engaged the fall wheel then so the telescope could make the whole circle around the edge of Heaven and he could relax.

The other visitor had been so long ago that he almost forgot about him. As a matter of fact, back then he had thought of him as nuts. He had requested to see one of those places with esoteric names taken from the holly books and he was so nervous, as if he expecting to see some naked goddesses taking a shower. Might it be that he was not such a fool and that his nervousness was for other reasons he didn't suspect? He had dismissed him so utterly that he erased him from his memory. It had been long ago. The guy was of a high rank, he might be a High Priest by now, he might even be at the Conclave. What was his name? Where was he from? He couldn't remember, it's been too long ago.

----

Ferbin helped Allucio to set the telescope ready. He was quiet, as most insomniacs were, not having many people to talk to and he was curious enough to be interested in whatever they were doing. Finally, as usual, Allucio took the eyepiece and set it down by the seat, laid down on it and slided under the telescope. He fixed the eyepiece to the telescope, disengaged the hand cranks to let the telescope move freely and moved it to the edge of Heaven where the shadow of Mother would enter. Then he engaged both hand cranks so the telescope would be secure. He pushed himself out from under the telescope and rolled out of the seat into the floor so he could still see Ferbin when he moved under the telescope. Ferbin laid down and, a little clumsily at first, managed to get to the observation position. Allucio instructed him on how to raise the support for the head so he could be comfortable, and then how to focus the image.

"In a moment, you are going to see the shadow of Mother entering Heaven from the top. You know, our midnight eclipse is their midday eclipse. The sun is under our feet right now, well, it would be if we were standing, it is in our nadir, you know, zenith up, nadir down. Now, look at the hand crank you have on your left. Turn it clockwise, you should see the edge of Heaven sliding off the top of your view. Use the knob at the end of the hand crank, that way you can turn it faster, otherwise, you won't be able to follow the eclipse. Yes, that way. Good," Allucio kept instructing Ferbin, "Now, go back to the edge, slow now you don't want to overshoot, good!"

After a while, Ferbin exclaimed, "I see it, the monster of the dark is chewing into Heaven!", referring to a childhood tall tale.

"Start turning the hand crank, otherwise you won't be able to follow it. It is heavy to start moving it, but once it catches speed, it is easier".

"I lost it for a while, but I'm keeping it at the center of the image now. The dark side is not completely dark."

"No, our own atmosphere glows a little bit with the sun shining on the other side of Mother, right at our nadir and that glow provides a little illumination. Heaven's own atmosphere also diffuses some of the light it gets on the lighted areas into the darker areas."

"I've just seen a lake pass by, it is like a mirror, it almost blinded me."

"Later, I'll show you on a map what is it that you are seeing. You are about to reach the sea."

"Um, not yet ... now, yes, here comes the water, it doesn't shine as much. Is it the ripples on the surface?"

"Yes, I see you learn fast, yes unless there is absolutely no wind, the surface of the sea is rougher and it won't reflect that much. The lake you saw is in a deep valley and it doesn't get much wind."

"Now I see clouds. They are very bright."

"There are no dark clouds when seen from above, they all shine white."

"I see flashes of light on the dark side".

"Let me write down the coordinates so we can return to it later. If it is where the clouds were, you are looking at a thunderstorm."

"A storm in Heaven?"

"Yes, why not, it is a planet just like Mother, somewhat drier and arid, but it does have storms."

"It is not the image I had of Heaven."

"You are right, the artists like to picture the Gods in luscious gardens and shiny palaces but, you know, those gardens need as much watering as ours do. And, anyway, that's the imagination of the artist, not one of them has ever been there."

"Some pictures depict the visions of the prophets."

"So they say, anyway, when you read the written prophesies, few actually describe the background. Actually, I don't know why we call them visions if they are usually words, not views. Anyway, you should have reached the mountains."

"Yes, are they clouds or snow?"

"Possibly a little of both, they look the same shiny white from above. Your guess is as good as mine."

"Oops, my hand slipped from the crank, I'm not good with my left hand."

"Never mind, it is more of the same, just let it go, we've been across most of Heaven by now. Shall we return to the thunderstorm while it is still dark?"

"Yes, please".

"Ok, let me move the telescope. Please let me handle it, take your hands off the telescope and raise the lever on the left, it will be faster. Yes, that one, raise it". When he reached the right fall, he asked Ferbin to lower the lever and continued, "now, turn the hand crank counterclockwise about half a turn, that should get us back in the thunderstorm."

"We are already there, it must be big!"

"We could measure it, if you are interested, but you would miss the show, the eclipse will not wait for us."

"It seems so big that we should almost hear it, but it is too far away."

"Shame on you, Ferbin, apart from the distance, there is vacuum in between the planets and sound doesn't propagate in vacuum."

"Sorry, sir, I forgot. It is just that it feels so near. There's light coming from the top. It's the other end of the eclipse. Now it is all white, I can't see the lightning any more, the clouds are too bright."

"Let me show some other places."

There were several places that Allucio enjoyed seeing and he knew their fall and azimuth by heart. "Now, once again, hands off the telescope, please. Raise that lever on your left.". Allucio moved the telescope to reach the fall he wanted and ordered Ferbin to lower the lever again, to make sure the telescope could not hit the damned spiral stair. Now, he could leave it in the hands of Ferbin.

"You see that dial on your right hand side? That is for azimuth. Raise that lever on your right. Move the telescope so it gets to 41. Good, that's it, slowly now, oops, back a little bit" Allucio instructed Ferbin as he overshot his target. "Now, lower that lever on your right. Every degree is about 100 kilometers so now we have to do the fraction. Turn the hand crank on your right so its index points to 35. Not that way, turn it the other way, otherwise you'll get to 40.35 instead of 41.35. Yes, that way, good. Now, do the same with the hand crank on your left, make it 87. Yes, that way. Ok, now, it is still dark, isn't it?"

"Yes, I believe I can see something there as my eye gets adjusted, but I can't say what it is."

"Well, the eclipse should be over in a few minutes on that particular spot."

"Yes, here it comes," said Ferbin after a few minutes.

"You should see a curved line going from the top-left to bottom-right, with craggy lines branching off on either side, and those lines branching off over and over, correct?"

"Yes, more or less, there are clouds at the bottom. It looks like ferns, but more chaotic".

"Well, you know how to use the hand cranks to move, just don't raise the levers, but otherwise you can move around and explore. What you have there is a canyon. The greenish flat area on either side is the plain around the canyon. The yellowish craggy parts are the cliffs that make the edge of the canyon and, the curved line is the river that carved the place."

"It is hard to make it go where you want it, this fall and azimuth thing is not natural. Ok, here, yes I can see like flashes of light, from the water perhaps? I can see some dark green patches."

"Perfect, yes. The flashes are reflections in pools of water. They come and go as the wind upsets the surface. The dark green patches are valleys populated with trees while the lighter green ones, if you find any, are probably grassland. At least, that is a guess based on what we have here. It should be spring there, that's why it is so green, in autumn some trees loose their leaves and the grass turns yellow so it is all quite monotonous. The cliffs remain yellow all year round since they are so steep that no vegetation holds onto it, or very little to make a difference, so we mostly see bare rock. The flatland around is yellowish green all year around, since there is little water up there, far from the river, so the vegetation there is, I guess, scrubland."

"Amazing!"

"Now, lets go for some mountains. Hands off, raise the left lever." And after a while, "Lower the left lever, now raise the one on the right." And a little later, "lower that one. Turn the left hand crank to show 57, the right one 40. If there are no clouds, you should be looking at the highest peak in Heaven, or at least the highest in the side we can see."

"Yes, the sky is clear so all the white I see should be snow, right?"

"Exactly. Now, if you look at the ground, it somewhat resembles the cliffs around the canyon, the difference that the canyon is a deep groove in the land while this one goes up, but the craggy lines branching off in all directions are pretty similar, aren't they?"

"These look a little softer."

"These are more eroded, the canyon is mostly sheltered from the winds and it doesn't snow in that region. In the area you are looking now, if it was winter, it would all be completely white, all covered in snow."

After a few minutes, they moved to a further location.

"I can't make any sense of this. There is blue which is clearly water. There are several shades of blue, which means different depths. Then, there is a lot of green and brown. The green looks like vegetation, but the brown is not dirt, it is too flat and it shines too much."

"The blue is sea water, you are right on that. The green are islands with lots of vegetation. The brown is also water, a river carrying lots of silt so, in a way, you are looking at a lot of dirt, suspended in water. You are looking at a delta, pretty much like the one of Nera, east of here, but much larger. The river comes flowing from the bottom left of the image and goes into the sea, on the right. It is very flat terrain so, instead of breaking into two or three main branches as the Nera does, that delta opens wide into more than a dozen branches, with lots of islands in between. Sometimes, depending on the rains upstream, when there is a lot of it, it carries the silt into the sea and you can see the brown extending like a fan into the sea. When there hasn't been enough rain, the blue sea water gets inland and the river gets darker as the silt settles to the bottom."

"I've never seen a brown river, the water runs clear where I come from."

"Water is clear where I come from as well or in the delta of the Nera but I've seen silted rivers when sailing. They are usually in large plains, the rivers are wide and shallow and they run slow. Those deltas are hard to sail, you always have to ask the locals because the silt that comes from upstream eventually settles down in the bottom and occasionally one branch gets clogged and you can't sail through it any longer. Then comes the rainy season and the water comes rushing down and it washes away a whole island and then you get a canal were there was none before. It's really tricky."

Ferbin remained looking through the telescope for quite some time. He had given him a couple more of interesting coordinates. He seemed quite able to handle the telescope alone, he just warned him about hitting the stair when approaching the edges of Heaven. He asked for the coordinates of the river delta once again and remained quite some time exploring the surrounding area. Then, it was time to have a meal, a long nap and then, back to the tough job of clearing the entrance. Allucio closed and secured the telescope while Ferbin cooked.
