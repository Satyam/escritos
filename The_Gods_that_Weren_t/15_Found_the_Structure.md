# 15 - The Structure is Found

It took several more shifts to finally get one of the panes of the door clear. They had cleared the handle some time ago and it didn't seem to be locked, but the door would not move with the weight of stone leaning on it. At least they found they had cleared the correct side, they would not need to clear the other side.

There was nothing left to do but open it, or try to do so. They had been anxious to do it but they feared it might be sealed shut so they had tried to avoid facing the issue. Quite late they though about taking a picture, but it was late now, neither of them had a camera and borrowing one from the sleepers would be bad manners. Ferbin gestured Allucio to go first so he tried and, quite to his surprise, the door opened. It was somewhat heavy and the hinges had rusted so there was a lot of creaking, but it just opened. Considering that it was under several tons of rocks, it made sense, after all, a padlock at that point wouldn't have made a difference. With each carrying his light, they crossed the door and found themselves in a concrete tunnel going further into the mountain for a few meters and then darkness. Apparently it opened into a much larger space that their light couldn't reach. The air was cold and musty.

"That is not just a room, it seems quite large, I can't see the end of it and there is no floor either", said Ferbin who still expected a room.

"Lets get closer", replied Allucio and started walking.

There were no railings so they approached the end with some caution. It was like a platform into the void.

"This is huge, sir! This is huge, I can't see the end of it, no floor, no roof", exclaimed Ferbin.

"There are some steps going down on this side, anything on yours?"

"Yes, there are steps on this side as well. I can't see the bottom of it, the wall simply goes on for as far as the light reaches."

"Did you notice the wall is neither vertical nor flat?", added Allucio who actually knew that from the drawings.

"Yes, this seems to be a circular chamber and it gets narrower as it goes upwards".

"Lets go back to the Observatory, I bought same flares at the ship supplies store."

"Ah, that was the sailor in you, sir".

Allucio realized Ferbin had gone serious with all that calling him 'sir' again. He had dropped that after a few shifts working together but it came back now. They returned with the flares and a sounding line, also from the same shop.

"Lets stay back from the edge, Ferbin, the glare of the flare might blind us and make us loose balance."

"I'm leaning against the wall, sir, I won't move"

"Ok, here I go. Look away from the flare."

Allucio was right in the middle of the opening of the tunnel into the platform, well away from the edge. He held the flare up in front of him with one arm while he pulled the cord to light the flare with his other hand and looked away. Now they could see the roof of the cavern and all around to the other side. It seemed it took all the space available at the top of Pinnacle. They both approached the edge of the platform. The cavern widened on its way down and it was huge, so much that they still weren't able to see the bottom clearly, they didn't know if they saw some shadows or imagined them. The light from the flare wasn't steady either so that didn't help.

Allucio passed the flare to Ferbin and took the sounding line and with the practiced movements of a sailor, threw it over the edge. The lead weight at the end didn't hit anything, and it was a 40 meter line, about twelve stories.

The flare started to sputter so they returned to the tunnel, away from the edge.

"Why don't we throw the next flare into the cavern?", asked Ferbin.

"We don't know if there is anything flammable down there. Perhaps there is an archive full of paper documents and we would enter the history books as the greatest fools who burned half the history of humanity."

"Then, perhaps, we can tie it to that rope of yours, you should be good with knots, sir".

"Yes, I guess we can do that. And it is a line, not a rope. What are you doing?"

"I thought that it would be safer if we crawl on all four to the edge and then lay down. It should be the safest way to look down."

"Good idea, I'll stay standing to light the flare and drop the line and then I'll join you. Here, catch the end of the line, I don't want to let it drop, it is better if we both hold it."

Allucio was tying the flare when he said, "No, this won't do. The flare throws sparks and if it burns upward, it might burn the line and, if it burns down, it will throw the sparks into whatever is at the bottom and we can cause a fire."

"Then why don't we use one of the lanterns. We should be pretty near the bottom of this place and the light of the lantern should be enough."

"Yes, lets do that."

So, they were both laying down, face down looking over the edge, with the lantern tied to the end of the sounding line in between them. Allucio had the end of the rope tied to his wrist. Ferbin took the lantern and slowly lowered over the edge while Allucio held the line. As it got tight, he started letting go, slowly at first and then as fast as he could without burning his hands from the friction. They saw what they both had guessed, the cavern got wider as it went down. They were able to follow the stairs going down from their platform. The light reached another platform several stories down that, unlike theirs, went all the way around. They could see two openings like the one they were in, one right below them, the other right across. Since there were no tunnels visible on the outside, they assumed they were blocked as theirs had been. Two more circular platforms were further down. Four sets of stairs went in between those. There were also four openings on each.

At the end of the line, they barely saw the bottom. The base of the lantern itself projected a big shadow. They tried to swing the lantern from side to side. As the lantern moved, the shadows changed so that gave them a sense of depth that the hadn't had before. It also gave them a better view of the floor.

"What is it down there?"

"I don't know, but they are distributed very regularly in a grid."

"Yes, let's swing it further."

"I'm trying."

"They are like tubes, cylindrical columns, I can't get a sense of their height."

Of course, they were, thought Allucio who had almost forgotten them, they were the top end of the metal bars embedded in the base, possibly to fix machinery on them.

"Anything flammable down there?"

"No, nothing but those columns."

"Shall we throw a flare then?"

"I think we can do that, yes. Let me reach one". Allucio was now on his knees ready to light the flare. "Look away from the flare, here it goes". He lighted it, threw it as far as he could and then laid down on his stomach as he was before, to see it fall.

The flare was still falling when he looked down. Now they could see the cavern all at once. It was huge. It was like a cone. Columns went all the way up from the bottom to the very top. Their platform was in between two such columns. They were quite thick at their height but they were far thicker at the base. The platforms they saw were made of slabs of concrete supported on projections jutting out of those columns. There were other such projections regularly distributed on the columns, possibly to support more platforms or other equipment.

"Shall we go down and explore?"

"I think it would not be a good idea. With no railings, so much debris and no lighting, we risk falling. We should do it with better equipment and tools, at least a camera to take pictures, otherwise, we risk ourselves for nothing."

"Then, what should we do?"

"While the flare lasts, enjoy the view. In the meantime, let me tell you something. I'm afraid I haven't been sincere with you. We suspected this cavern might exist, there was never a room for some experiment or other, I made that up, I'm sorry."

"Well, this is much bigger, literally, than any experiment."

"It certainly is a great discovery, but also a disturbing one. It means that Pinnacle, the seat of the supreme religious authority, the seat of Elvar himself, is artificial, fake. Not just artificial, but built with a purpose, a clearly non religious purpose, a factory perhaps or, more likely, a weapon."

"A weapon?"

"If this were a cannon, it would be pointing straight at Heaven, isn't it? Right behind the High Temple. Have we been praying for peace in front of the greatest weapon in the Great War, a weapon pointed at the Gods?"

After a moment in silence, Ferbin asked, "But how did you know it was here?"

"Looking for something else in the library we found a set of engineering drawings that had been completely misplaced and forgotten. We started studying them and recognized some geographical features on the coast. At first we could not quite believe what we were looking at, but many things matched, the city itself, the port, the river to the east, the coastline as it was before the Promenade was completed and, of course, Pinnacle itself, though it did not look like a mountain, but an artificial structure in this very same place. The problem was, we didn't know if this whole thing was actually here. Perhaps it was a project that never got built. It wasn't worth making a fuss about it until we knew. The Librarian suggested we tried to explore it discreetly and then we could figure out what to do about it. That's why I told you about the room carved into the mountain. If we didn't find anything, then, that story was harmless. But now, it turns out to be true. I didn't mean to keep you in the dark but I wanted to minimize the risk of the news spreading. I trust I can count on you to keep quiet, at least until we can find out how to best announce it."

"Yes, of course, sir", replied Ferbin going formal again.

"So far, there are four of us, the Librarian, Bengo, an assistant librarian who I was working with to catalog these papers, you and myself. You see, the drawings were part of a set of documents that had been stored in the Observatory, that is why I got involved in the first place. The Librarian thinks deciding about this is above even someone of his seniority, but at this moment, in the middle of the Conclave with all the changes it will bring to the hierarchy of the Order, he is unsure who to tell, and so am I, the gossip is that my chief is on the cards for a promotion. Before making a fuss about nothing, he asked me to find out if this thing really existed."

"I see, sir, you can count on me, of course. I won't tell anybody. Anyway, I'm not sure anyone could believe me. This is big, I mean, not just physically big, it is mind-boggling! The religious guys will go crazy."

"I believe you are not deeply religious, neither am I, but the problem is that most of our society is underpinned in a lot of religious beliefs. Elvar was the Supreme Priest. He created this society out of the ashes of the Great Collapse. The current Supreme Priest, or the future one, and all the Priests derive their authority from his. Even I'm a ThD, a Doctor in Theology, simply because there is no other kind of doctorate. And religion is based on a lot of symbolism. Pinnacle is one of those symbols. What happens when it proves to be a fake?"

"So, what shall we do, sir?" said Ferbin standing up to leave as the flare had gone off.

"We have to report our findings to the Librarian. He will probably ask us to wait until the Conclave is over and he can figure out who to report it to. In the meantime, we should tidy up this place, close it and make it appear as a regular construction site, just in case any visitors come up."

"Actually, sir, if we want to keep visitors off, we might better make it dirty, scatter some rocks at the entrance, spread some dirt around."

"You are right, we can water it and make mud. That would also keep all this dirt from floating around and into my telescope."

"Back at moving rocks?"

"Not many, just at the entrance."

"But the door is visible from there if anyone uses a lantern, are we going to cover it with rocks?" Ferbin said as they reached the mouth of the tunnel, passing under the ladder that was holding the roof.

"How about if we use some of the bushes and branches we cut when we started, make a big bulk in the middle of the tunnel and put a canvas on it. Then we tell them that's as far as the tunnel goes. I don't think anybody will want to pass under the ladder, it looks flimsy."

"We'll have to muddy the joints in this rocks, we can't leave the concrete visible."

"Ok, we have plenty to do, we will improvise as best as we can. But lets grab a bite and return to work after a nap."

----

Allucio woke up by a knock on the door, but he went back to sleep as he had probably dreamed it. "Master Allucio?" said a female voice along the next knock. That was no dream. He jumped out of bed, got into his dressing gown and slippers and went to open the door. There he found a couple of women.

"Master Allucio I believe. Sorry to disturb you, I see you were taking a nap. My name is Anisia, this is Fania. How do you do?" she added, bowing her head as was customary. That triggered the normal response from Allucio.

"Ms Anisia, a pleasure to meet you, Ms Fania" replied Allucio bowing to each of them in turn. The surprise left him speechless beyond that. Further courtesies escaped him and the questions that were thundering inside his head seemed impolite to ask.

"We were wondering how was the excavation going, have you found anything? I am sorry, I forgot to mention, 'our benefactor' send us here to ask", added Anisia stressing the 'our benefactor' part.

Allucio's face was a catalog of all possible levels of amazement. "Our benefactor, I see. Please come in."

"Better not, I believe you are not alone and since we were lucky that your assistant didn't wake up from his nap, we might better leave things that way until you tell us how much he knows. That will spare us using further euphemisms like 'our benefactor'".

"Yes, I see, well, it is a little chilly outside but the tunnel is sheltered and that's what you came to see, right?"

"Precisely."

"This way, please", said Allucio while closing the door behind him and leading them to the opening. He lighted a lantern they had right by the entrance and went in. "Please, be careful here, stay away from the edge, there are no railings and no protection", he said when they crossed the door.

"There is not much to see here, the light gets lost in the dark", said Anisia.

"Yes, Ms Anisia, if you want to see it better I can light a flare but I would suggest you go down on all fours and approach the edge carefully. You might want to lie down on your belly." Allucio waited while they did so. "Now, I'm going to put the lantern on the floor and pick a flare. Don't look at me while I light it, the glare would blind you and you would miss it all. Keep looking ahead or down into the void." He lit the flare and held it up for a while, then he threw it down. Anisia, who was belly down on the floor, trembled a little  when she looked down to the floor so far down. Fania, who had stayed on all fours and had moved towards the edge following the flare on its way down, suddenly moved back in fear, but recovered promptly and slowly moved back to the edge.

"Well, you did it Master Allucio. This is wonderful!" said Anisia when the flare started to burn out.

"Stay there for a while, until you get used to the light of the lantern", instructed Allucio as it seemed they wanted to turn around and raise.

"Oh, yes, thank you. It is easy to get dizzy."

"Shall we go back to the tunnel, this side of the doors, and sit there?" suggested Allucio.

And so they did.

"Sorry about the surprise, but we needed to know whether you had discovered the structure and I see you have."

"Well, you should know, shouldn't you?"

"No, we didn't. We were quite sure the structure existed but we needed confirmation. We certainly didn't know the state of it. I personally didn't know a thing about this whole business until a few meals ago."

"But who are you?"

"My name is Anisia and I am from Heaven, though I have lived in Mother for the last four years under another name. This is Fania who you may know as Space Wanderer, an alias she uses when writing for the Wanderers Magazine. She is from Mother and didn't know we existed until this night."

Prompted by Anisia's introduction Fania finally spoke for the first time. "It is a pleasure to meet you, Master Allucio, Ms Baria and myself edited your article for the Wanderers Magazine".

"A good article, if I may say so myself", added Anisia.

"Thank you. It was a nice experience to write for the general public. I hope I didn't sound too pedantic".

"Not at all, sir. And we received a good number of letters from our readers. Had I known that I would meet you in person I would have brought them with me."

"Very kind of you. I hope they were positive."

"Mostly. We discarded the idiotic ones and there are always people trying to show off by contradicting everything."

"That's what we, in academia, call 'esteemed colleagues'".

"If I may", said Anisia feeling the two might go on forever, "the transmitter says our communication window will open in a quarter of an hour and I would like you, Master Allucio to talk to our people in Heaven, in the meantime, I want to ask you who is your assistant and what does he know?"

"How do you know I have someone helping me and, by the way, how did you get here, flying?"

"I've been here alone earlier in the night to confirm that you had started but since it seemed obvious you had not found anything yet, I refrained from showing myself. And no, we didn't come flying, we just got a key for one of the service doors. Too many people have copies of those keys, firemen, night watch, suppliers, cooks. That's what I've been told myself when I asked. So, about your assistant."

"Yes, his name is Ferbin and I told him that I found some drawings of a very large structure under Pinnacle and that we wanted to confirm if it was really there."

"We who?"

"The Head Librarian, a library assistant and myself."

"No one else?"

"No, just us."

"What exactly do they know?"

"Bengo, the library assistant and myself discovered the drawings of this structure, not the ones you provided us but originals long lost. We reported that to the Librarian. Night was approaching and with the Conclave going on with the changes it will surely bring to the hierarchy, we weren't sure who to report it to or whether there was anything at all to report. Thus, we deferred until we could confirm it."

"And what about this ... Ferbin you said?"

"Ferbin, indeed. He came along the retinue of one of the High Priests and since I could do with another pair of hands, I told them we would go on an archaeological expedition. I made up a story about a room for a scientific experiment that might have been dug into the top of Pinnacle. He didn't know about the structure until we found it and then I told him the official version."

"Which is?"

"That there might be a man-made structure under Pinnacle. That we just bumped into the drawings and we don't know its purpose. That we meant to discover first if it really existed and then find out if it was dangerous."

"Dangerous?"

"Well, when Bengo, the Librarian and myself discovered the drawings we started to speculate on what this structure might be and someone suggested it might be a weapon from the Great War and that it might be dangerous."

"Well, it isn't, is it?"

"It seems empty. We saw the same as you saw, we didn't explore it. I felt is was unsafe to risk going down and seeing it looks empty, it wasn't worth it."

"Time for the transmission, we need to go out into the open, the signal won't reach here."

They all stood up and went out. A light turned on in the transmitter indicating the satellite was in range. Anisia pushed a button and the display prompted Anisia for a security code to confirm it was she.

"Anisia, can you hear me?"

"Load and clear. Master Allucio and Fania are here with me. We are in the tunnel that goes into the structure. I can confirm the structure does exist and it seems to be in good shape."

"Master Allucio, Ms Fania, nice to meet you. My name is Jobas, I hope you remember me Master Allucio."

"Yes, I do. Nice talking to you again. I'm sorry I cannot meet you in person, I'm a little far away."

"How far does this wireless reach?", asked Fania.

"Well, that is a long story. Anisia, could you explain that to them later on? By the way, were you able to take pictures?"

"I'm afraid not, Jobas, the place is dark and Master Allucio here lighted it with a flare, which didn't last long. By the time the surprise wore off and I remembered about the pictures, the flare was dying out."

"Please take those pictures and send them in the next transmission. Can you do that?", asked Jobas.

"Do you have more flares, Master Allucio?", asked Anisia.

"Yes, four more of them, I believe, but no camera."

"The wireless, as you call it, contains a camera so it can transmit those pictures", added Anisia.

"While we have our transmission window, may I ask you, Master Allucio, what the structure looks like?"

For the next few minutes Allucio explained what he saw and replied to Jobas questions about certain details. With the drawings as the basis, Allucio managed to be quite concise. When the transmission was over, they went all back again in and Anisia got ready to take the pictures while Allucio threw a couple of flares. Anisia declared that she had enough pictures.

"Master Allucio, are you there?", came the voice of Ferbin.

Allucio looked at Anisia asking for instructions. They had to wait for instructions in the next transmission window so they had to stay put and that meant facing Ferbin. Anisia simply waved him to carry on and in a low voice said "Introduce us and let me handle it".

"Ferbin, we are here?"

"We?"

"Yes, we have company. Two ladies."

From her earlier visit, Anisia knew that Allucio was not alone so she was more or less prepared with a suitable story. Their common condition as insomniacs and both Fania's and Allucio's relation to each other through the magazine provided a starting point for explaining their presence. As they were coming inside the Observatory for a cup of tea, Anisia asked Allucio -by name, without the honorific- if he had moved the furniture around, hinting at a previous visit and possibly a relation. Ferbin caught it soon enough. Allucio felt uncomfortable, which was the whole idea. Ferbin, noticing Allucio's discomfort, very politely avoided any further mention of the matter and Fania, who knew that Anisia had never met Allucio before, barely held a big laugh.

Anisia had little more than an hour to spare and she thought having Allucio and Fania talk about his article and the readers replies was the most innocuous. Of course, talking about the big structure inside Pinnacle was unavoidable, and trying to keep quiet about it was making the conversation really awkward thus Anisia broke the ice and asked, "So, what do you think about it? What is it you call it? The 'structure'?"

Sounding as casual as he could make it, Allucio replied, "Well, as I told you, we don't really know. We just found the drawings which date back to the Great War and we decided to find out if this structure was really there and, surprisingly, it is. And, now that I think of it, do you know the most funny part of it all? It has always been there for everyone to see?"

"Well, with this camouflage ..."

"Oh, no, I'm not talking about the structure, but about Pinnacle being artificial. Sorry, my thoughts were ahead of my words. I was thinking that this structure shows Pinnacle is artificial but it just happens that there is an image of Pinnacle without the structure in a very public place, a mosaic in the Great Temple. Millions of people must have seen it. Plenty of scholars have, at least one has written a couple of pages in a book about the artwork in the Temple, and all of us who live right her must have seen it as well. As Bengo, the assistant librarian, found out in an art book, it is one of the mosaics recovered from an earlier temple destroyed long ago. It shows Pinnacle as an artificial oval island linked to the coast with a causeway. The Great Temple in that image is more or less where the current one is, right where the causeway meets the island. The area at the back of the temple is a big, raised esplanade, flat at the top which is probably a quarter as high as Pinnacle is right now."

"So, you mean, it is missing the top?"

"Indeed, it is as if they had shaved off the top of it."

"And nobody noticed in all these centuries."

"Nope, I don't believe anyone has. But you have to understand that many of those images are in the ancient style were the size of the elements give a clue to their symbolic relevance. Thus, our guess was that nobody noticed that Pinnacle looked small simply because they though the artist meant to highlight the Temple and made everything else small."

As the time for the next transmission window approached, Anisia brought the conversation back to Fania's visit, which was her first to Pinnacle, beyond the Great Temple. She said that with all the excitement she had forgotten to take her up to the top of Pinnacle, to enjoy the view all around. She asked Ferbin if he would be so kind as to take her there. She made it sound as such a pathetic excuse that both Ferbin and Fania realized that Anisia and Allucio meant to be left alone for a while, though only Fania knew the true reason.

Fania was very excited. She had never been with so many insomniacs together. Her family had always made her feel ashamed of her condition, always hiding it, and she kept hiding it even when she left for college. She had an intelligence well above average even amongst her fellow students and interests few shared which also contributed to her isolation.

Now, she was with three other insomniacs and all of them very intelligent company and one of them was not just interested in space, she came from another planet! Another was an astronomer and, as far as she knew, the best one in Mother. She would like to talk about, well, just about everything with Allucio and Anisia but could not do so with Ferbin there and now, she was stuck with taking Ferbin out of the way. Well, at least she would be able to enjoy the sights.

----

"Ms Anisia", started Allucio but Anisia didn't let him continue, "I'm sorry, Master Allucio, please forgive me, it was the only excuse I could think of that would require almost no explaining."

"Well, at least it made Ferbin keep his thoughts to himself, whatever they might be."

"I hope you don't find those thoughts completely disagreeable", retorted Anisia who was feeling a little mischievous. "Never mind, just kidding. Let me check the transmitter."

The transmission window was already open and the transmitter had started uploading the pictures of the structure. Anisia typed her secret code to identify herself and she immediately got an audio reply. It was Jobas' voice. After checking who was listening he said, "Master Allucio, we agree with your plans. We believe the Head Librarian is a judicious person and so is your immediate superior though we don't know if he will still be your boss after the Conclave. Chances are that he will raise in the hierarchy and there is a good chance so will you. Please, understand, this is what we deduce from intelligence we gather through public news, rumors and gossip. I don't want you to think we are puppet masters here."

"The Librarian himself hinted the same", added Allucio.

"So, you see, it is almost public knowledge now. As I was saying, our estimates show the upcoming changes will be favorable to our goals, but there is still uncertainty and we imagine several possible outcomes. I would expect the news of your discovery to be handled discreetly until the Conclave is finished and the new hierarchy is set, if for no other reason that you have no one to give them to. That is what you had planned anyway. There is no need to keep it secret. You planned on being discreet and we think this is good enough. What do we do beyond that depends on who gets elected Supreme Priest and how the top hierarchy gets arranged. That is why we have to ask you not to miss your daily meetings with the lawyer and perhaps even expect Anisia to get in touch with you after the Conclave should we have further instructions."

"What we really need to ask from you is that you do your utmost to preserve the structure. We don't mind if the tunnel gets closed again, in fact, we'd rather you camouflaged the entrance before daybreak, but make sure no permanent damage is made to it. We feel this is rather unlikely but want to make sure. The engineering guys are right next to me watching the pictures you've just sent us and they say it all looks good and it is in a more advanced stage of construction than we expected. We just don't want it to be vandalized. The story about it being a weapon from the Great War might not be helpful. Please, downplay that idea. We'd like to suggest the structure might be some sort of observatory, the mother of all telescopes, so to speak. One of our engineers has drafted some possible configurations for such a telescope and other possible instruments and your transmitter should be receiving them as we speak."

"Yes, I see the incoming data light flashing", added Anisia.

"Good. Just take a look at those drafts and use them as your own if the occasion comes up. Just to counterbalance the idea of it being a weapon."

As Jobas stopped talking, Anisia looked at Allucio as if expecting an answer so Allucio said, "Understood. Camouflage the entrance, do as the Librarian and myself had planned and preserve the structure. Keep in touch via the usual link through 'our benefactor' or wait for Anisia to call me."

"Perfect, I couldn't summarize it better. The transmission window is closing. Anisia, you are free to leave after showing Master Allucio the drafts. Thank you both. Bye."

----

"Who is this Jobas guy?" asked Allucio once the transmission was over.

"Well, I just met him briefly. I helped in his departure back to Heaven."

"So, he is really up there in Heaven?" interrupted Allucio.

"Sure is. Didn't you notice the delay?"

"Of course I noticed. It seems he is unsure of what to say, like he has to take his time to think about what to say, and then goes into long speeches."

Anisia burst into laughter and after a while said, "Oh, I am sorry, I couldn't prevent myself. I never realized that the delay could be interpreted that way. No, it is not that he takes his time to think about his replies. It is the distance in between Mother and Heaven that produces the delay. It takes a little under a second for any signal to travel in between the two planets, twice that for a reply to come. They hear the same delay on your replies, even though you reply as soon you hear the question. It just takes time for the signal to reach them."

Anisia allowed some time for Allucio to digest that. "So, who's Jobas?", repeated Allucio.

"He's been down here in Mother for a couple of years planning for all this. Right now, he is the top guy managing our relation with Mother. He had been interviewing lots of people, reading the newspapers, attending conferences, you name it, just to get a good feeling of which way the wind blows. I have just learned about him shortly before sunset."

"What is it that you do?"

"I can't really tell you. I can't even give you my name. That is, Anisia is my real name, but it is not the one I use on Mother. We are not all spies down here, in fact, most of us just have normal, legitimate jobs. A few of us have been drafted to help with this contingency, with the Conclave and all that. After this, I'll wear my lab coat just like any other day. Well, I'm a chemist by training, I don't think there is any harm in you knowing that much."

"And what about Fania?"

"She is from Mother, just as you are. In fact, she didn't know we existed until earlier this very night. We recruited her because of her writing just as we recruited you for your skills. I am the only person from Heaven she knows". True enough, thought Anisia, since so far Fania didn't know Baria and Jon were also from Heaven.

"What is this transmission window you talk about?"

"A transmitter big enough to reach Heaven would be too big so we have a small relay in orbit around Mother. The transmitter reaches the satellite and the satellite reaches Heaven. We use those in Heaven as well. We have several satellites orbiting Heaven so there is always one, usually more, within reach. We have just one orbiting Mother, they aren't cheap, you know? We launched it for this operation. It takes little more than an hour to do a complete orbit and it stays within reach for about a quarter of that time. That's the window."

Allucio's face showed all the symptoms of an information overflow.

"Shall I make some more tea?", suggested Anisia.
