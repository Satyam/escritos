# 2 - The Keeper of the Calendar

The sun was starting to light up the eastern horizon of Mother while Heaven was half lit, half dark. Soon the atmosphere above the Observatory would be bright with daylight and further observations would be impossible. Sleepers would be coming out of their hibernation and would be up in a couple of hours. By the time he shut everything up, packed his things and started his way down, the refectory would be receiving its first guests with fruit and juices while the cooks got the fires going. Porridge would be next but bread would not come until the first meal.

The start of a new day was always strange. Sleepers would wake up at different times, sometimes the younger before their elders so children might cause some mischief or, quite often, babies would cry and some neighbor would need to take care of them until the parents woke. Sometimes the grocer would be still asleep while both the customers and the suppliers waited outside doing business directly with each other.

Sometimes, sleepers would not wake up at all. The old and the weak might not have the energy to rekindle the body back to wakefulness and so remained asleep until their internal reserves were consumed. Others would not have had enough reserves to start with. Those were placid deaths, with both the dead and the family asleep during the process with all the goodbyes having been said during the last meal together. Others were not so lucky, an infected minor wound might kill an otherwise healthy individual during the night, as bacteria never slept. Of course, major illnesses would be treated by insomniacs during the night, but the minor ones, those easily dismissed, could prove fatal.

Being a sacred place, the most sacred on Mother by some accounts, the Great Temple of Pinnacle would be receiving a crowd over those first hours with mourning families bringing pictures or other mementos of their beloveds while others, more religious and wealthy enough to pay for a fancy funeral, would bring the body of the deceased to the Temple for the blessings and then to one of the many chapels in the grounds for the vigil.

Allucio was not involved with those ceremonies, not being an ordained priest himself, but he would have to attend a funeral this time, that of the Keeper of the Calendar, who was found dead when someone went to check on him after he missed breakfast and the first meal. The title was an anachronism, everybody could have a printed calendar at home and clocks to know the time and, to be fair, the ancient people were not such idiots that they could not determine which day or time of the day they were living in, at least with as much precision as each required. People no longer feared disasters when the regular noon eclipse failed to happen, the calendars already showed when they were partial or missed. The time for planting and harvesting was no secret either, but the title of Keeper of the Calendar remained.

The position of the Keeper was obsolete in another sense. The Keeper also used to be the Head Astronomer and, nominally, he still was but, due to his age and poor health, there had already been two successive _acting_ Head Astronomers. The succession would have been turned into disarray if the Department of Astronomy was of any importance within the Order, but it hadn't been so for quite some time. So the Keeper was kept as a courtesy to him but ignored in practice and the succession resolved without much trouble, because, being a lesser department, there had been little competition.

The Keeper was the second most important person in Allucio's department so he would have to play his role in the ceremonies which, fortunately, were to be austere and brief. Allucio was sorry for the poor man, but he hardly had any contact with him. He had been sick most of the time for as long as Allucio could remember; his nominal functions, trivial as they had become, had been performed by the acting Head himself or his assistant and he had no other responsibilities, neither teaching nor researching.

Allucio expected to be seated in the second row behind the department heads with all the rest of the department and listen to the usual platitudes. He was in his room checking out his best gown when a boy knocked at his door with a message from Master Enuas, the Chair of Physical Sciences and acting Head Astronomer to call on him which, of course, he immediately did.

He knocked the door of the Head's office and was immediately admitted in.

"Allucio, I want to ask you to read the Keeper's eulogy", said Enuas as soon as he entered. Allucio just had to do a brief nod with his eyes down. "You'll focus on his early work before he became the Keeper. You know them from your own studies. We might do well to skip over the chronology, it would only highlight the absence of anything significant in these last years. I've just received the folder with previous eulogies from the archives, you might want to use them as a model. They are all much alike but, fortunately, since people don't die so often, nobody will notice the repetition. Can you do it?"

Allucio could not but reply "Yes, sir" and approached to take the folder that Enuas was handing him.

"Please bring it to me before the first meal the next journey so I can check it. You may go now, you don't have that much time". And so he did. He immediately went to the library to get copies of the earlier works of the Keeper, basically, his only works as there were no recent ones. When he arrived, the Head Librarian himself called from his desk in the back, "You are from astronomy, aren't you?".

"Yes, sir", replied Allucio, "I came to get a copy of the Keeper's work for his eulogy".

"The former Keeper, you mean. I collected them here", said the Librarian while reaching for a side table and picking up a small pile of publications, "I asked my assistants to fetch them as soon as I learned about his passing away. You didn't know him, did you?".

"No, sir", replied Allucio, "he wasn't teaching by the time I came and I didn't report to him".

"Nobody did, poor man. I was wondering who would do the honors. You have quite a responsibility in front of you".

"Master Enuas gave me the folder with previous eulogies to help me get going", said Allucio opening the folder on the counter.

"I don't mean the eulogy, not that it isn't important, you'd better do it right, but later on if you get the job". Seeing Allucio's confused look at his observation, the Librarian continued, "You are probably too young and the succession in your department has been quite in disarray with the Keeper being in such a poor state of mind". One of the assistants was coming down one of the aisles. "Let me help you with that job", he continued while signaling Allucio to join him in one of the private study rooms. "Close the door behind you and sit down", said the Librarian while seating himself. After looking at his face for a while, in a lower voice he said, "You are indeed relatively young, but your publications are already twice as many as the Keeper's at this same point in his career. The _former_ Keeper, I should say. You have twice the time we sleepers have, that's true, but you are also quite active and independent. After all, who are you going to consult with in those long nights when everyone else is sleeping".

"Traditionally, the eulogy is read by the anointed successor", he said after a pause for emphasis. "If matters take their traditional course in your department, it means Master Enuas is backing you as the next Keeper". He allowed for some time to let it sink in. "And, the Keeper is usually the Head Astronomer, so Master Enuas might be thinking on dropping that one on your plate as well, after all he is just acting Head. So, let me help you with that, you do want to get it right. All the Heads will be there checking on you. You may put that file on the side, they all look the same because I wrote most of them. Any instructions from Master Enuas?"

"Yes", said Allucio, "he told me to focus on his early years and avoid dates".

"Very prudent, nobody would care to hear how his mind wandered these last few years. It got to the point when they wouldn't think about asking him for his resignation because he wasn't aware he did have a position to resign from, and dismissing him seemed too cruel. They just skipped him, the Head before Master Enuas took over came from another department altogether, but was a friend of his so the joy of seeing his friend becoming Head compensated for his own circumvention. An old man, he didn't last long. Master Enuas was also brought from elsewhere, but at this point he didn't even realize it was him that was being bypassed. Shocked?"

Allucio realized his face was showing his discomfort at listening to all this gossip.

"You'd better start getting used to this from now on. If you do get designated Keeper, you will start to deal with politics within the department and amongst them, and politics, in such a closed community, is based on gossip. So, the first thing you need to do is read a good eulogy. You wouldn't want the first piece of gossip to be spread about you to be what a bad eulogy you wrote. Were you inspired by any of the former Keeper works? Is any of your own research related to his?"

"I'm afraid not", Allucio replied.

"Can we stretch it a little bit? You see, this is your opportunity to introduce yourself, your work, your goals. Does Master Enuas want to read it when it's ready?"

"Yes, he asked me to check it with him."

"Ok, he probably has something in mind, he knows your work and the Keeper's and, after all, it is his proposal so let's leave this to him."

----

In the end, nothing could be added to a rather dull and bland eulogy, which was all that everyone seemed to expect. The inconsistency in between the former Keeper lofty title and his actual duties as well as the unusual mechanism for succession in the Astronomy department had long stopped being an issue. The whole department was a minor one within the Order with the current and previous Heads having been brought from other departments and neither of them had any particular devotion to the matter. Had it not been for the Observatory, the whole department might have been closed and the Telescope taken care of as just one more piece of historical value.

Except for the endowment. Nobody knew where the money came from. A trustee in the city handled the funds which provided for the upkeep of the Observatory and the dozen or so people that made the department. As Allucio would soon learn, Astronomy didn't cost a dime to the Order and that ensured its continuity. All the pious wording he'd been using in his requests for resources might have been wasted.

By the end of the day, Enuas informed Allucio that his proposal has been accepted and he would be the next Keeper of the Calendar. The Council would formally appoint him the next day. The position of Head Astronomer would remain vacant and Enuas would still be acting as such but Allucio would start taking over those duties from Enuas, who had been performing them on behalf of the former Keeper. He would need a sash and beret with the colors of his new position, perhaps a couple of new gowns since he was going to have to attend to more public events, and he would have to move to the apartments of the Keeper.

Everything went so smoothly that it seemed as if Allucio was the only one surprised by it all. In the meantime he carried on with his routine since nothing special would happen until the next day. Another night of observations was ahead and he had to update his list of locations with not enough readings and then take care of the more mundane aspects of living alone for the full night: clothes, food as well as some light reading and now, some not so light reading: the budget of the department, which would be his responsibility from then on. The actual accounting would still be done by the same assistant who would now report to him instead of Enuas.

----

The night was singularly productive, with the cloud cover over Heaven quite sparse so that he was able to fill in some of those readings he had pending for so long. Going through the budget, though, wasn't that good, which was somewhat scary because he would have to meet the trustee after his formal appointment and he assumed he would have to look sharp.

His appointment came right before the first meal on the second journey in the council hall, with all the Heads or their representatives attending. After Master Enuas read his nomination and the secretary read the approval of the Heads, the Grand Master confirmed his appointment and signaled an usher to handle him his new sash and helped him don it while another usher handled the beret to Enuas, now standing by his side, who placed it on his head. Everyone approached to congratulate him and then they all went to the refectory were he was shown to his position in the head table.

Later that same journey Enuas took Allucio to the offices of the trustee in the city. From then on, every day he would have to visit him with the accounts. Their meeting would usually be mostly a formality and occasionally requiring some higher level decisions while the assistants would take care of the actual numbers. This time it was more of a social occasion with the expected introductions and well wishing.

His new lodgings were quite some change. He didn't know what to do with the extra space he now had but he really liked the light and the air coming in from the much larger windows. His new duties involved more meetings with Enuas and supervising the assistants, who really didn't need much supervision anyway.

----

Half a year into his new position, in his sixth daily meeting with the trustee, Allucio had an unusual request from him.

"Master Allucio, I have this envelope to give to you. I was instructed to handle it the day before the long equinoctial eclipse, which should happen tonight. It has information about an observation you are requested to perform on a particular set of coordinates in Heaven". After giving the envelope to Allucio, which he immediately opened and began reading, as the trustee evidently expected him to do, he continued, "as you know, I don't know the identity of our benefactor, but I understand he or, perhaps she, is a devoted amateur astronomer. You might believe that your handling me the papers produced by your department each day is a mere formality but, over the years, I have received several letters from our benefactor asking for clarifications and questions which were far from trivial, certainly nothing that I could possibly understand and that Master Enuas sometimes had some trouble answering. So, I don't expect to understand those instructions but, I have to ask, is the request clear to you?" asked the trustee when Allucio raised his eyes from the letter.

"Yes, counselor,", replied Allucio, "he asks me to watch a spot at a very precise set of coordinates, during the midnight eclipse, for some phenomenon that seems somewhat unusual. He doesn't say what is it that I am supposed to see, claiming he wants an unprejudiced observation." 

"Anything else?", asked the trustee.

"If my memory doesn't fail me, the place is relatively flat, in a cloudless area, very easy to see."

"I meant about the letter itself."

After a while, it dawned on him, "The benefactor is an insomniac!"

"Indeed, that is what it seems. We, and I mean Master Enuas and myself, we don't know who the benefactor is but it seems he is an insomniac or at least he has access to observations only another insomniac could possibly do."

"Well, he has access to my nightly observations, perhaps those of others as well?"

"Master Enuas is of the opinion that he is directly involved in his work, that it is not derived from the work of others, that he is personally involved in astronomy. I can't say myself since most of this correspondence is incomprehensible to me. Anyway, I am not trying to find out who our benefactor is, after all, it is my duty to protect his privacy nor is it in anyone's interest to find out since he might terminate his support if he is displeased with us which we may assume he would be if we were to intrude in his private life which he obviously wants to keep private."

Allucio felt a confirmation was required from him, "Yes, I see, I understand."

"Good. I believe that some degree of knowledge about our benefactor is good so that we can better repay his generosity. For example, we may assume that you will not need to simplify your reply to his request so that, say, someone like myself could understand it. Master Enuas has often pointed out how much he knows about the subject. Likewise, we may assume that his request is not a trivial one."

For a moment, Allucio had thought this request to be a nuisance and he wondered how could he avoid being distracted that half hour he was expected to watch that spot, but the further they talked about it the more his curiosity was picked.

"May I add that your work was of particular interest to our benefactor?", continued the trustee, "Master Enuas has received a number of requests for clarification which I am sure he passed on to you. Discreetly, by his request."

Allucio realized the reason for some of the unexpected questions from his boss over time. Were they his or had they originated with the benefactor?

"In fact, our benefactor has let us know how happy he or, as I said, possibly she, is about your appointment. He instructed me to tell you so and to also tell you that he expects discretion on your part as Master Enuas and myself has shown these past years."

It was clear a reply was expected of him and, given all he has learned, he was happy to provide it.

"Of course, counselor. I have to admit I knew nothing about our benefactor and this conversation has been very enlightening. Half a year ago I didn't even know there was an endowment. Later I though it might be just a whim of some rich fellow, an inheritance or some such. I now feel a lot of respect, even admiration for our benefactor and I fully respect his desire for privacy."

"Good", said the trustee, "that's what I expected to hear from you. One more thing, our benefactor has requested me to ask you for a number in between 3 and 10".

"A number?", asked Allucio totally baffled by the trivial request.

"Between 3 and 10", repeated the trustee as confirmation.

"Four?"

"Four it is then. Please remember that number until our next meeting".

"I will", replied Allucio, wondering what was it all about.

"And the reply to his request must not be shared with anyone, not even Master Enuas or myself. You are to give it to me in a closed envelope."

"Yes, if he wants it so."

"So, we'll meet next day at the usual time. Our assistants are probably done by now. Shall we adjourn?"

Which of course was not a question at all. Allucio left with the number four going round and round in his mind. It felt like some sort of magic trick, quite the opposite of all the seriousness of the previous conversation. He could not decide what to make out of the benefactor. It had all seemed so sound at the beginning. He recalled some of the questions his boss had made about his reports over time, the ones that seemed to come out of the blue, and assumed they came from the benefactor, which indicated a high degree of knowledge and even experience from him. But magic tricks? Four ... four ... Oh dear!
