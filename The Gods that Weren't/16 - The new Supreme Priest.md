# 16 - The New Supreme Priest

The last couple of days had been hectic for Anisia. Besides the couple of visits to Pinnacle, she had to drop messages in a couple of places for them to be picked first thing in the morning and beat the regular mail. The most intellectually demanding, though, was Fania. Her thirst for knowledge was limitless. After all, Anisia was a chemist, she didn't know that much about celestial mechanics or life in other planets besides Heaven and Mother. Admittedly, in a few subjects, her high school physics was better than the best physics taught in Mother but Fania was fast to learn and soon enough was asking for more. And she wasn't much of a space-woman, she just happened to travel once through space in an autonomous capsule capable of doing the whole trip with its passengers hibernating, as was usually the case.

Fania had been particularly disappointed that Anisia had never worn a real spacesuit. Of course she had used the environmental suits they used to go outside the domes or the vehicles, but Heaven did have an atmosphere, too thin, dry and dusty, but survivable with just an oxygen mask to keep its partial pressure high enough and goggles to keep the eyes moist and the dirt out. The full suit was no more than a coverall to keep the dirt out but otherwise, you could go naked if you later took a good shower and lots of moisturizing cream. Which reminded her of ... but never mind, all youngsters did it and all adults pretended they didn't notice they've done it. She wasn't about to talk about that with Fania, not right now.

Then, the day came and she had to help Baria and Jon with their stuff, besides catching up with what had piled up in her factory while she was at the spiritual retreat. Of course she hadn't given that excuse to the people in the factory, it wouldn't have served to explain the urgency of her trip. The retreat excuse was for the guys renting the meeting place. In the factory she said she had gone to help with some manufacturing problem, almost a disaster, in the main factory.

She had to help Baria with the conferences they planned, contacting the authors and arranging schedules. Baria had to travel to check on some of the facilities to hold the conferences in, leaving behind a long list of things to do. She still had the transmitter so she also served as a communication center. The truth was that all these didn't really amount to much in terms of time. It was mostly the excitement and the unusual hours. Her naps were shorter and not as sound.

Then, there was the news. After the night sleep, the High Priests finally elected their primus inter pares. Baria had subscribed to a news service so they got the news quite early and, with the transmitter, they kept Heaven, the Farm and the other people having transmitters updated. It was night in Heaven so most of the people there were asleep but with Anric at the Farm and some top insomniacs at Heaven, the plans were constantly updated and new orders issued.

Then came the message from Parelta that Anisia had to arrange to meet Allucio. The request came from Allucio through the usual channels, Parelta's colleague at Pinnacle City, with no explanation and no apparent reason but it seemed urgent. Anisia was to go to Pinnacle and take the transmitter with her. At least she was going to transmit the news -or the gossip that passed for news- right from the source.

----

Allucio had not recovered his lodgings yet, which included his private office so they met at the office of some colleague of his. Anisia pretended to be coming for an interview for the Wanderers Magazine. Once alone after being served some tea, Anisia asked, "Can we talk now?"

"Yes, there is no one else in the apartment."

"So, what happened?"

"I've been offered the position of Chair of Physical Sciences as my boss, the current Head, Master Enuas is to take another post he cannot yet disclose."

"Good for you!", exclaimed Anisia with real pleasure.

"Too good. Too good to be true."

"What do you mean, aren't you the natural successor for that post?"

"One of the possible successors and the youngest at that. It is not just that. I recognized the newly elected Supreme Priest." Anisia simply made a face like saying, "so what?", Allucio continued, "He is one of yours, isn't he?"

"How would I know?", replied Anisia.

"Then who?"

"Listen, I brought the transmitter with me. There is not much people awake in Heaven, certainly not Jobas who's a sleeper, but there are others here in Mother who might know. Let me see ... the transmission window comes in about 5 minutes. I'll set it up so it will open a channel to Anric as soon as the window opens". Anric was his real name, not the legal name he used in Mother so it didn't matter. She wasn't supposed to mention the Farm since that would provide a tangible clue.

While they waited, she asked, "So, did you break the news?"

"About the structure? Yes, to the Librarian and Bengo as soon as the Library opened. Ferbin was with his group so he didn't attend. I confirmed that the structure existed. None of us had any chance to tell anybody else since everyone above our level was at the Conclave or preparing for it. Then, after the vote, everyone was even more busy. A lot of people will retire with the outgoing Supreme Priest, a bunch of other people will be kindly asked to retire by the new Supreme Priest. There are plenty of positions to cover. Everyone is trying to ride the wave."

"The wave has caught with you, it seems."

"I wasn't swimming at all."

"So, what's wrong with that? Oh, wait, the window is opening". Anisia entered her code and got a voice at the other end saying, "Hi, we've called him. He should be here right away". The speaker sounded uneasy trying to leave names out of the talk.

"Master Allucio here knows my real name and I mentioned Anric's name since that is not his local name. There is nobody else listening."

"Ok Anisia, good to know, here he comes."

"Hello, Anisia, Master Allucio, a pleasure to talk with you. My name is Anric, I'm the general manager for our operations here in Mother. How may I help you?".

Clearly uneasy, Allucio replied, "A pleasure to meet you too Anric", but then was unable to continue.

Anisia, knowing she was using one of only 4 channels available and that the window would last for only another 20 minutes intervened. "Master Allucio here feels uneasy because he was offered to replace his boss as Chair of Physical Sciences and he believes he knows the new Supreme Priest and suspects that he works for us."

"It seems all too good to be true", added Allucio.

"I see", replied Anric, "and I have to admit I agree with you. It all seems too good for us as well. You know, I wasn't awake when you talked with Jobas up in Heaven but I read a summary of that conversation. I remember that Jobas used the phrase 'we are not puppet masters'. I remember it because I didn't know what a puppet master was. Jobas traveled in Mother more than I have and he collected a lot of idioms I've never heard about. Anyway, it was in the report because he had to assure you we were not puppet masters. Is that what concerns you?"

"Yes, indeed, it is."

"Well, I can confirm you are not the only one we have ever contacted and we did so in the same terms as with you. We have no power of coercion over anyone. We have none with you. We have asked you to do something for us and we expected that you would accept, but were ready to accept that you might not want to. We are not blackmailing or bribing anyone to do anything against their will."

"On average, we have only asked about one in ten of our contacts to actively do something for us. With a few people, we have not contacted them ever again. We believe they will act on their own accord in our favor. Of course, we don't contact just anyone, only those that we trust that will respond positively to our plight. The point is, it is hard to ignore our existence and knowing, as we believe, that an open and sudden disclosure of our existence to the general public will be disrupting to their society, they try to work towards making that disclosure with as little harm as possible."

"But these are just words, I think I can give you an example which I'm sure you will understand. May I ask you what position is your boss, Master Enuas, going to take over?"

"You probably know that better than I do, don't you?", replied Allucio still somewhat upset.

"No, we don't. We have expectations, we have probabilistic analysis but knowledge? No, we don't know. We do expect him to rise in the hierarchy, but so do most of your own commentators in the media. But as to certainty, we don't have any."

"He is rumored to go very close to the top, as high as can be expected by one who is not an ordained priest."

"You've seen him, did he look as someone raising or sinking?"

"Raising, undoubtedly raising".

"Ok, well, lets use that as our example. Right now there is a bunch of people running around here in the situation room where I am updating our plans based on your report. You see, Master Allucio, we have a very intricate plan with lots of alternatives or branches, as we call them. Each branch influences the rest. Each has a probability and its influence on other branches has a weight. For example, your information right now has raised the probability of the branches where your boss goes up and has trimmed the branches where he retires."

"But how can you handle all that?", asked Allucio.

"The computer handles that. Please, Anisia, after the transmission is over, explain to Allucio what a computer is. Right now, they are showing me a few branches that involve you. In some of them, you raise to Head of Astronomy, in others you reach the Chair of Physical Sciences. In others, you remain in your current position or take other academic positions of about the same level. In others, you retire or are fired. Assigning a null value to the probability of you being fired, the probabilities on the other alternatives rise.  Our numbers show that your probability of getting the new position has raised from 72% to 78% thanks to the new position of Master Enuas. We are not ordering you to accept that position, but we estimate that it is quite likely that you will, and we act based on that estimate."

"As you can see", continued Anric, "we don't control the events but we collect information and act on it. More or less as the traders do in the bourse. Actually, we do trade in the bourse, well, people do that on our behalf, and we invest in many companies. We don't control those companies. We cannot influence the decisions of their directors, but we can predict the consequences of those decisions. Traders do that in their head, by intuition. We use this computer I mentioned."

"Just as stock traders invest in companies, which is of mutual benefit for the investor and the company getting the investment, we invest in people. We have provided you with suggestions and advice on your work and that of your colleagues and students. Your success is for our mutual benefit. But don't think that your whole career was arranged by us. If you allow me to continue with the same analogy, it wouldn't make sense to invest in companies that are not worth it. We invested in you because you are capable and intelligent. You would have done well with us or without us. But you should know this already. You can probably estimate how much our advice has helped your research."

"But you have funded the Observatory, that is a quite direct action", objected Allucio.

"Indeed, it is. You know we need access to the structure. The Observatory happens to be right on top of it. That is why we are funding the Observatory. And you happened to be on top of the Observatory, so to speak. So, you see, we never had any particular plan for your career, we never manipulated your career. You happened to be there and you happened to be good and we invest in good people in the right places".

"So, we are back to you. We would appreciate your telling us whether you plan to accept the new position or not. That would certainly improve our estimates. Can we order you to do so? I wish we could, but we can't and we don't need to. Everything would be much easier for us if you accepted, but we have alternatives, there are other branches, not as good, but still feasible. The overall probability of success of our plans would raise one and one half of a percentage point if you accept. Yes, that is the overall weight of you in our plans, 1.5%. It was 0.3% a day ago. Why? Because a lot depended on who got elected Supreme Priest. It could have gone wrong for us but it didn't and now your value for us has increased fivefold. Still, 1.5% doesn't sound as much, I hope your ego doesn't feel hurt. It also means that we can do without you. There is much more at play and you are just a part of it."

"You ask whether the Supreme Priest works for us. At this stage, on my responsibility I will tell you. Both, your boss and the Supreme Priest have been contacted by us. They don't work for us, not any more than you do. We have disclosed our existence to both of them. I'm telling you about Master Enuas because you would have been told about that in the near future anyway."

"You played a light show for them?" asked Allucio.

"I don't know, have we? Someone is looking into that."

"I was there in the Observatory, that is why I recognized him, the Supreme Priest, I mean", added Allucio.

"I see, we didn't know that. Yes, they tell me, that was the initial contact with the Supreme Priest. You were already there? Anyway, I'm afraid I prefer not to disclose how we contacted your boss."

"But he does work for you."

"Once again, he doesn't work for us. None of you do. Even Anisia's work for us is voluntary and she is one of us. We asked her if she wants to help and she agreed. We have contacted them, they know about us and we have asked them to help us. Whether they will or won't it is up to them just as it is up to you. We have told each of them our plight up there in Heaven. We have told them what we would like and we have told each one what we can offer in exchange. To each one according to his or her interests. For example, I am sure that what Anisia can tell you about computers will be most interesting to you. You could do marvels in your own specialty with computers."

"I have the file of the Supreme Priest here. We learned that he would be interested in health. A brother of his died of a decease now practically eradicated. Do you know we have already saved an estimate of 7 million people in Mother? Right now, we are about a hundred thousand from Heaven. Each of us has somehow saved 70 people on Mother thanks to medicines we helped develop. A hint here, a suggestion there, plenty of letters to the right people. There are still many deceases that are still killing or disabling people in Mother and we could cure them, but how to do it in secret? We have coped with the most dreadful deceases and we are quietly working on the rest, but we can't do miracles."

Anisia got nervous about this last bit. She wasn't supposed to talk about her job because that might lead to discovering a whole trail of companies they owned but the way Anric said it, it seemed as if they weren't directly involved.

"Isn't it fair for us to ask you to help us ensure our survival? We have asked others and most of them, not all, have agreed. Now, the transmission window is almost over. At this point I don't want to press you into a rushed decision. There are four branches ahead of us, resulting from the combinations of two independent decisions you have to make, to accept your new position and to keep helping us. If you are still willing to help us, Master Allucio, please, I must ask your help in making arrangements for a meeting with Master Enuas, Anisia and yourself. He expects a reply from you about your new position, and so do we, so I'm sure he'll meet with you. I'm asking you to take Anisia with you. You see, at this point, I have told you about your boss but he doesn't really know about you. He suspects, we are sure he almost knows. We should now make formal presentations. Please, arrange the meeting for a transmission window so I can do the honors, it would be only fair."

"If you don't want to continue helping us, simply let Anisia know and then she'll tell us the next time we connect. Time is up, sorry. A pleasure to meet you Master Allucio and my best wishes for you, whatever you decide. Bye Anisia."

"Bye Anric", said Anisia.

"A pleasure to meet you too, sir." said Allucio.

"I have a question for you", said Anisia after she closed the communication.

"Yes, I know, everyone wants to know".

"Well, not everybody, Anric already knows what a puppet master is, I don't."

"That's your question? I'll tell you what a puppet master is and you tell me what a computer is. Deal?"

"Deal".

"But not now, I have to arrange a meeting with Master Enuas. Can you write down for me the times for the next few transmission windows?"

"So, that means you are willing to work along us?"

"Yes, it would seem so."

----

Compared to that, the rest of Anisia's day was almost uneventful. Master Enuas expected Allucio but he didn't expect him to come with a stranger. After the initial surprise and once alone, Anisia identified herself and since the transmission window was already half past, she put Anric on the line right away. Anisia was surprised to learn that Anric was the person who had initially contacted Enuas some years ago. After apologizing for having told Allucio first, he told him that Allucio knew about Heaven -which was already obvious- and, furthermore, he wanted Enuas to know that the new Supreme Priest also knew. It was important at that point that all three of them knew about each other but, just as it would have hardly be possible to reach Enuas without Allucio's intervention, at this point it was impossible to get in touch with the Supreme Priest.

Anric said they had no special requests to make to any of them but that they assumed the attitudes of all of them towards helping Heaven was favorable and that they would surely work towards that goal. They simply considered that at this point being open about the knowledge they all shared would be beneficial because, if for nothing else, they would not waste time hiding it from each other. Furthermore, except for Allucio, their new positions might render inoperable their current means of contacting them, leaving Allucio as the only way until better arrangements could be found.

Certain that Enuas would not be authorized to say much, Anric mentioned the rumors about his future and politely asked him how he would rate those rumors. Anisia admired the cautious and diplomatic approach of Anric. Enuas, declined to be more specific but said that the rumors seemed close to the mark.

Allucio accepted the new position. Beyond that, it had not been much of a conversation. He meant to tell him about the structure inside Pinnacle but Enuas was extremely busy, he said he had scheduled barely enough time to get a yes or no from Allucio before leaving for a meeting elsewhere which he proved true by gathering a couple of folders and herding them out of his office ahead of his own hasty departure.

After talking about computers and puppet masters, Anisia left and returned home. The rest of the day went as before, catching up with even more of a backlog at her factory and helping with the conference. There were going to be three of them during the next day and they would all be advertised in the next issue which they were putting together. These were the trial ones. There were going to be four more the day after that in major cities and possibly more to come depending on the success of the earlier ones.

After they had sent the next issue to the printer, they all sat together and confirmed what by then was quite obvious, they told Fania that Baria and Jon were from Heaven. Fania had proved discreet and nothing in all she wrote for the magazine they had just finished gave any hint of what she knew. With Anric's approval, they decided to tell her because it would make it easy for all of them.

The night was quiet, something Anisia really needed. Fania's excitement had subsided and, with little else to hide about them, talking to her was easy. Anisia couldn't tell Fania about the Farm or the Island or any other facilities or people beyond those she already knew, but Fania didn't seem to care. Anisia felt on more solid ground when Fania asked about planet formation, after all, as a chemist, Anisia had to analyze soil samples so she knew some geology and a little about the formation of rocks.

----

Allucio's night had also been busy, though less physically demanding than the previous one. With better lighting, some safety equipment such as ropes and harnesses and a camera, Allucio and Ferbin went all the way down exploring the inside of the structure. Which didn't really reveal anything interesting. There were other doors going outside but they were unmovable probably shored up by rocks as was the one they uncovered. They carried copies of the drawings and they duly marked any differences they noticed.

Ferbin enjoyed some more observation time with the telescope. Otherwise, insomniacs were used to long nights alone so even when there were two or more of them together, they were never intrusive with the others. Allucio certainly appreciated that since he had lots and lots of things to think about.

The next morning brought the big ceremonies with one Supreme Priest retiring and another taking the post. The ceremonies would end with a banquet and then each one would retire for a long nap. After that, most of those who attended the Conclave would disband. Allucio would recover his lodgings, his place in the tables and, hopefully, his taste for the food served.

Then the announcements started. Open to the public, in the esplanade in front of the main temple, flanked by the Great Mother and other bigwigs, the new Supreme Priest came to the balcony over the main portal to give his first discourse:

> Sisters and Brothers, from the Seat of Elvar, I speak to you.

> Our world has prospered greatly thanks to his guidance and the loving care of the mothers. The world has changed over these centuries. He suffered both the Great War and the Collapse that followed it. He had to abandon this place, there was nothing but the ruins of the Hight Temple that stood in this very same place. As most in those cruel days, he wandered around a ruined world until, his strength depleted, the mothers who sheltered him restored his health. The experienced changed him. He saw that the faith he had led needed change. The world had changed dramatically and the faith had not, the rituals, the prayers, the dogmas were all still the same and they seemed empty, completely meaningless for the survivors of that world.

> He led a great change, a change that has brought us the world we now live in. But even the world he gave us has changed, not as dramatically as his, but it is not the same. We are not struggling to survive. Our population has grown and is at sustainable levels. We have avoided outgrowing our resources. We live in a world of plenty.

> The Priesthood, being the only organized institution left standing in a time of great need and, with the enlightened guidance of Elvar and his successors in this seat, assumed the burden of government. Radiating from this very place, the neighboring cities and towns started to rebuild, sow, teach and learn.

> Forgiveness didn't come easily, so many beloved ones had been lost! But the poise and equanimity of Elvar and the love and care of the mothers overcame the mistrust, and the renewed faith spread to the furthest reaches of the world.

> Our society has changed since. The Priesthood has adapted to fulfill the role society demanded from us. But that has put a lot of strain upon us. We are overreaching. We are stretching the benefit of the higher moral position we inherited from Elvar to intervene in mundane affairs that are of no moral, ethical or religious consequence. We are devoting too much effort on them, which distracts us from our true path. People are becoming less devout. We, as priests, are failing. We are becoming an empty shell, paying lip service to the faith via ritual and ceremony but totally immersed in the mundane.

> We must retire from government.

> From the Seat of Elvar, I declare that it is my will that a Civil Government be established.

By pronouncing the prescribed formula, 'From the Seat of Elvar, I declare that it is my will ...', it became law.

> I name Master Enuas, Head of Government.

> In the next few days Master Enuas will convene a committee to establish the form that the Civil Government will take and how to transition to it. The current structure will remain in place, operating as it does now, until explicitly changed. For that purpose, he is to summon the best people, whether from the Priesthood or not, a Mother or not, whatever his or her personal beliefs might be.

After a pause for effect, he continued.

> Our religious doctrine has provided the basis for the conduct of the people. These are a mixed bag of religion, ethics, faith and ritual. The loss of faith in our society is eroding our principles. We, as priests, cannot but accept that ever larger numbers of our people cannot find solace in religion. By having everything in the same bag, these people, by dismissing the religious principles, might be disregarding the basic, universal human principles contained in them. The value of the whole is diminished by contagion.

> From the Seat of Elvar, I declare that it is my will that a Charter of Basic Rights be written.

> I myself will convene and head a committee to redact that document. We will distill the most basic rights to be granted to every person from all possible sources, religious or not. It will be our duty, the duty of all of us, believers or not, empowered or weak, to sustain those rights and respect those of others, regardless of beliefs, gender, age or origin. It will be the principle of our justice.

> From the Seat of Elvar, I declare that it is my will that a Supreme Court of Justice be established.

> I will convene and head this Court which will uphold and adjudicate based on the Charter of Basic Rights. As the Supreme Court is convened for the first time, after the Charter of Basic Rights is established, I will renounce my privilege as the highest magistrate of the land in favor of this Court.

> The Head of Government will be responsible to present a plan to establish similar courts at every level of the state and the procedure to transition to them.

> From the Seat of Elvar, I declare that it is my will that all authorities currently holding positions in government and justice will continue to perform their duties until such a time when the transition at their level takes effect.

> In order to be as less disruptive as possible, it is hoped that most of them will retain equivalent positions according to their abilities and experience.

> This is a change for the future, to allow more and better qualified people to take over vital functions within our society, regardless of their religious beliefs, if any. It is not a wholesale dismissal of the current system that has served us for so long.

> Let us pray together for the success of this great endeavor. For those who do not wish to join us in prayer, please grant us your best wishes for success.
